"louise ,
thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long .
thanks again ,
claudia

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

"attached is the latest version of the cost center assignments for the transfers out of ees . these transfers will be effective july 1 , 2001 and i need to get this to hr by friday , june 1 , 2001 to give them time to get everything effected .
i think i have incorporated all your comments , but please review one more time and make sure we have not included anyone we shouldn ' t have or excluded anyone . you ' ll note that at this point we are not forming east and west risk management cost centers . don and rogers have decided for cost management purposes to leave it consolidated at this point .

"louise ,
thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long .
thanks again ,

just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?

rick ,
we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

rick ,
we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?

thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would

just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .

do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?

thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?

subject : tenaska iv
rick ,
we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and

do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a

we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would

just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .

do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?

rick ,
we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

"louise ,
thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long .

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

"louise ,
thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long .
thanks again ,

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

"louise ,
thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long .
thanks again ,

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

whalley to employees who have signed on with ubs warburg energy , with
costas ' s announcement attached . ( both will also be

we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks
louise

just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks
louise

whalley to employees who have signed on with ubs warburg energy , with
costas ' s announcement attached . ( both will also be

rick ,
we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

rick ,
we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

"attached is the latest version of the cost center assignments for the transfers out of ees . these transfers will be effective july 1 , 2001 and i need to get this to hr by friday , june 1 , 2001 to give them time to get everything effected .
i think i have incorporated all your comments , but please review one more time and make sure we have not included anyone we shouldn ' t have or excluded anyone . you ' ll note that at this point we are not forming east and west risk management cost centers . don and rogers have decided for cost management purposes to leave it consolidated at this point .
once you have signed off on your groupings , rachel massey in corporate planning will be working with each of you to forecast your q 3 and q 4 cost center expense plans .
please let me know asap of any changes and don ' t hesitate to call with questions .

"louise ,
thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long .
thanks again ,

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks
louise

rick ,
we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

"attached is the latest version of the cost center assignments for the transfers out of ees . these transfers will be effective july 1 , 2001 and i need to get this to hr by friday , june 1 , 2001 to give them time to get everything effected .
i think i have incorporated all your comments , but please review one more time and make sure we have not included anyone we shouldn ' t have or excluded anyone . you ' ll note that at this point we are not forming east and west risk management cost centers . don and rogers have decided for cost management purposes to leave it consolidated at this point .
once you have signed off on your groupings , rachel massey in corporate planning will be working with each of you to forecast your q 3 and q 4 cost center expense plans .
please let me know asap of any changes and don ' t hesitate to call with questions .

subject : tenaska iv
rick ,
we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long .

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

rick ,
we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .

"louise ,
thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long .
thanks again ,

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .

we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long .
thanks again ,

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

"louise ,
thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long .
thanks again ,

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

rick ,
we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

fred
here is what i came up with on the ivanhoe station .
>",NO_IGNORE
"attached is the latest version of the cost center assignments for the transfers out of ees . these transfers will be effective july 1 , 2001 and i need to get this to hr by friday , june 1 , 2001 to give them time to get everything effected .
i think i have incorporated all your comments , but please review one more time and make sure we have not included anyone we shouldn ' t have or excluded anyone . you ' ll note that at this point we are not forming east and west risk management cost centers . don and rogers have decided for cost management purposes to leave it consolidated at this point .
once you have signed off on your groupings , rachel massey in corporate planning will be working with each of you to forecast your q 3 and q 4 cost center expense plans .
please let me know asap of any changes and don ' t hesitate to call with questions .
thanks
wade",NO_IGNORE
"louise ,
thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long .
thanks again ,
claudia

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

rick ,
we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would

just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

"louise ,
thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long .
thanks again ,

structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long .

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

rick ,
we need to talk about the ability of ena to continue its the current role as agent of tenaska iv .
1 ) since the end on november , ena has not been able to complete gas trading transactions . we cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in texas . this , of course , is due to the bankruptcy . as a result , we are not able to sale tenaska ' s excess fuel . we did contact brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a gas daily price , but they do not want it ( gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while ) . in december , we had to cut 10 , 000 / day from the 7 th through the 27 th . for january , we haven ' t had to cut yet , but i am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future .
2 ) for november activity ( which was settled in dec ) , ena owes tenaska iv for the excess supply that we sold . however , due to the bankruptcy , we could not make payments out . ena could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline . james armstrong paid the counterparties directly . i think that he should continue to do this for dec and jan . we should not transfer any funds from tenaska iv to ena .
i don ' t know how enron ' s ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding . but we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management .
please give me a call or e - mail me . we can get together sometime thurs or fri morning .

"louise ,
thanks so much for your speedy reply . i will pass your comments on to dave walker in media relations .
i included kevin because he is listed with you , greg and john on a "" management "" slide . if there are others who should be
included on greg ' s core management team for the announcement , please let me know who they are and their titles . please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include kevin . if there is an org chart , that might be helpful , too . it would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long .
thanks again ,

subject : re : releases
just a couple of suggested changes to both .
there is a lot of confusion in the energy market as to the ownership
structure of the entity . enron had previously announced that the entiy
would be 51 % new owner and 49 % enron . we need to ensure this message is
corrected as clearly as possible - that it is 100 % ubs owner .
( see attached file : ubsw energy release draft . doc )
on the release for ubswenergy . com - we do intend to trade physical gas and
power immediately initially at least in the areas we can , so i have removed
that sentence .
( see attached file : . doc )
do you need all of the commercial md titles or is kevin picked out for a
particular reason ?
thanks

if we can say done , the actual contract process can be slowed so that the equity is not set till the november meeting . also , if we get done , i wont bug you anymore !

"i consulted with kevin before i took the oars in trying to answer your
question , as well as the questions raised in drew ' s e - mail . here ' s what we
found out . . .
steve ' s question :
what economics would determine if a developer could site a power plant in new
mexico ( maybe 3 , 000 mw ) and build a line to the grid in california versus us
expanding to deliver the gas to a power plant in california ?
what you ' re really asking here is "" what are the comparative economics of
energy delivered by wire versus energy delivered by pipeline ? "" in this
analysis , there are a few considerations - - ( 1 ) original capital cost to
construct facilities , ( 2 ) the operating cost of the facilities , including
energy loss , and ( 3 ) environmental and other permitting considerations .
engineers tell us that , as a rule of thumb , high voltage transmission lines
and tower facilities cost approximately $ 800 , 000 to $ 1 mm / mile to construct
turnkey . this figure is comparable to the $ 1 mm / mile "" rule of thumb "" we use
for turnkey construction of mainline diameter ( 30 - 36 "" ) high - pressure steel
pipeline .
in terms of operating costs , for anything over 100 miles in length , there are
three ( 3 ) basic sources of energy loss in electric transmission : ( 1 )
transformation loss , ( 2 ) radiation loss ( efm ) and ( 3 ) heat loss across the
conductors . a rule of thumb for electric transmission loss is 3 % . this
number is comparable to the actual fuel used for compression on
transwestern ' s pipeline .
the most critical issue impacting construction of high voltage transmission
lines is in the area of permitting . there just aren ' t many new transmission
lines being approved . it was suggested by more than one source that an
electric transmission project on the order posited in your example , could
take anywhere from 6 to 10 years to secure authorization . the issues of
electromagnetic field ( emf ) radiation around high voltage power lines , along
with other wildlife endangerment concerns , are significant obstacles in
securing permits for right - of - way .
in short , the answer is that while the economics on face appear to be
comparable for construction and operation of both natural gas pipelines and
electric transmission lines , the protracted permitting process for electric
transmission lines tips the scale considerably towards the more immediate
returns available on investment in natural gas pipeline infrastructure .
drew ' s questions :
1 . what are the key factors that determine where a power plant developer puts
his plant ?
for purposes of this exercise , i ' m assuming we ' re talking gas - fired
generation . developers generally describe four considerations in deciding
where to site a new electric power plant :
1 . market area demand ( distributive ) and / or transmission access to market
2 . water rights for turbine cooling
3 . ease of permitting ( environmental , encroachment , fed / state / local
regulations , affected agencies / jurisdiction )
4 . proximity to natural gas pipeline / supply infrastructure
2 . do the transmission access and pricing rules of the various
utilities / power pools vary all that much or are order 888 tariffs pretty much
the same all over ?
ferc order 888 and 889 require public utilities to commit to standards of
conduct and to file open access tariffs affecting transmission among and
between other utilities and / or power pools in the various operating regions .
ferc ordered public utility transmission owners to provide transmission
access and comparable service to competitors and to functionally separate
their transmission / reliability functions from their wholesale merchant
functions . the rulemaking is analogous to the open access requirements under
ferc order 436 / 500 / 636 affecting interstate natural gas pipelines . it ' s
pretty obvious from the california example this past summer , that with
respect to the overall operation of a deregulated power market in individual
states , particularly as concerns the establishment and regulation of
independent system operators ( iso ' s ) , there is substantial room for
improvement ( and possible further ferc involvement ) .
"" in the open access final rule ( order no . 888 ) , the commission issues a
single pro forma tariff describing the minimum terms and conditions of
service to bring about this nondiscriminatory open access transmission
service . all public utilities that own , control , or operate interstate
transmission facilities are required to offer service to others under the pro
forma tariff . they must also use the pro forma tariffs for their own
wholesale energy sales and purchases . order no . 888 also provides for the
full recovery of stranded costs - - that is , costs that were prudently incurred
to serve power customers and that could go unrecovered if these customers use
open access to move to another supplier . ""
3 . how do ipp ' s decide what fuel supply strategy works best ( i . e . , buy
bundled delivered fuel from someone vs . buy gas , storage , transport , etc .
separately ) ?
in my experience , there is no "" one size fits all "" formula or strategy . for
example , in the past we ' ve seen calpine take a very hands - on approach to
supplying its ipp projects . in the mid to late ' 80 ' s , during the build out
of several qf ' s ( cogens ) , calpine bought natural gas reserves in the ground
and dedicated them to the project . in today ' s market , calpine has scavenged
the gas and basis traders from statoil and set - up a natural gas desk for the
purchase and transportation management of gas supplies needed for its western
u . s . power projects . in other projects , developer / owners and their lenders
are satisfied with a less active role in securing gas supply / transportation
to the project . in short , projects look at the liquidity of the gas supply /
transportation market in deciding whether they can achieve project economics
and secure reliable supply by taking bids or rfp ' s for gas
supply / transportation , or whether to take a more hands - on approach ala
calpine .
4 . what is the rto rule and why should we care ?
last december , the ferc issued order no . 2000 , a final rule on regional
transmission organizations ( rto ' s ) . order 2000 builds on the foundation of
orders 888 and 889 ( issued in 1996 ) . according to ferc chairman jim hoecker ,
order 2000 makes "" a persuasive case for separating control of grid operations
from the influence of electricity market participants . "" therefore , order
2000 can be seen as a natural outgrowth of the perceived limitations on the
functional unbundling adopted in orders 888 and 889 , continuing balkanization
of the electric transmission grid based on corporate , not state or regional
boundaries , as well as pressure to provide guidance on acceptable forms of
privately - owned transmission companies .
ferc prescribes a voluntary approach to rto participation . the order
initiates a regional collaborative process to foster rto formation . the
order also imposes filing requirements on the privately owned "" public
utilities "" that are subject to ferc jurisdiction , and requires these private
utilities to describe in their filings how they have attempted to accommodate
the needs of transmission owning state / municipal , cooperative and federally
owned systems . ferc believes that , regardless of format , rto ' s will offer
the following benefits : ( 1 ) alleviate stress on the bulk power system caused
by structural changes in the industry , ( 2 ) improve efficiencies in
transmission grid management through better pricing and congestion
management , ( 3 ) improve grid reliability , ( 4 ) remove remaining opportunities
for discriminatory practices , ( 5 ) improve market performance , ( 6 ) increase
coordination among state regulatory agencies , ( 7 ) cut transaction costs , ( 8 )
facilitate the success of state retail access programs , and ( 9 ) facilitate
lighter - handed regulation .
critics point out that with its emphasis on flexibility , voluntary rto
formation and transmission rate reforms ( i . e . , incentives ) , order 2000 defers
for case - specific disposition many of the tough issues that must be resolved
in order to create an operational rto . moreover , order 2000 does not compel
any transmission owner to join an rto , but provides only regulatory guidance
and incentives for willing participants , as well as a veiled threat of
further consequences for the hold - outs .
as to the final part of the question ( "" why should we care ? "" ) , presumably , the
development of a fully - functioning rto network will promote both the
efficiency and market transparency goals of the original ferc orders . as
ferc reads it , the future of gas - fired generation for both merchant and
utility systems , depends on an efficiently operated open access transmission
system . therefore , the promise of the rto is to stimulate competition and
the ongoing investment in new generation infrastructure . unfortunately ,
sources tell me that the voluntary nature of the rto program may ultimately
cripple its effectiveness in meeting its stated goals .
5 . has $ 5 / mmbtu gas killed the gas fired power market ?
natural gas prices of $ 5 / mmbtu can only "" kill "" gas - fired power plants in
those instances where ( 1 ) there are more economical alternatives to natural
gas fuel , ( 2 ) demand for electric power is offset through demand side
management or ( 3 ) natural gas in an environment of short supply is expressly
prohibited from use as a power plant fuel . in the western u . s . marketplace ,
particularly in california , i see no viable alternative to natural gas fuel
for electric power generation . renewable resources currently meet less than
5 % of the total electric resource requirements . $ 32 / barrel oil prices give
fuel oil no clear economic advantage over natural gas ( even at a $ 5 / mmbtu
price ) . moreover , california environmental and permitting regulations make
the installation of new electric generation based on anything other than
natural gas fuel or renewable resources virtually impossible . while demand
side management programs are the politically correct approach to meeting
resource needs , historically , they have served only a minor role in
offsetting the growth in electric power . as to the final point , i ' m unable
to comment on the risk of future legal / regulatory restrictions governing the
use of natural gas as a boiler or turbine fuel .

on this topic in shelley ' s electricity seminar last summer . now , john and
kevin have graciously agreed to join us tuesday at 1 : 30 to discuss recent
developments in electric markets and nn ' s and tw ' s efforts to attract power
generation load to the system . specific topics i hope to cover include the
following :
1 . what are the key factors that determine where a power plant developer
puts his plant ?
2 . do the transmission access and pricing rules of the various
utilities / power pools vary all that much or are order 888 tariffs pretty much

4 . what is the rto rule and why should we care ?
5 . has $ 5 / mmbtu gas killed the gas fired power market ?
depending on how deeply we get into these topics , we may need to schedule a
follow - up session at a later date . i look forward to seeing you on tuesday .

subject : corn subsidy govt program analysis
hi vince ,
nelson and i had a meeting yesterday with the ag desk folks on how to go
forward on the analysis and presentation for this program . the consensus
from the ag side was that the choice of university will be highly politically
driven , ie preferably the university should be from a state that has close
ties to sympathetic senators or other political figures . also it is
preferable if the university faculty have worked on ag issues before , lending
more credibility in the ag community . the names that came up were
mississippi state and texas a & m . nelson knows of a person at mississippi
state who worked with the usda on risk management issues .
the needed analysis itself is not necessarily very deep , and the focus is
primarily to get a non - quantitative presentation out that outlines how enron
can take on the downside risk of local crop prices ( enron probably needs to
cover actual local prices and not simply an index because i do not think the
govt will want to worry about basis risk ) .
the pilot program itself will be very small , and lends itself to continuing
down the path of short term trading rather than long term origination .
another thought on hedging our potential short positon ( on the origination
side ) is that the govt program can only provide a partial hedge to the extent
of the premium received - - we still have unlimited downside from the short .

with respect to enmax and credit requirements for a guarantor , there are no specific ratings thresholds in the legal documentation ( enmax ' terms and conditions ) . i will work with kate to ascertain who in enmax ' credit department knows what these specific ratings thresholds are ( if any ) . once done , either kate or i will advise .
with respect to general processes surrounding holding cash at a canadian bank , i know that enron canada ' s policy is to not take cash collateral by wire transfer into a bank account . the primary reason for this policy involves risks associated with our personal property registration system : to perfect a security interest in a wire transfer requires the registration of a financing statement ( multi - jurisdictional , cumbersome ) ; even with such registration one is not guaranteed priority . again , this is enron canada ' s position with respect to cash collateral ; i do not know why enmax would not accept the c $ 600 , but suspect that their reasons may be the same . as far as the "" process "" of holding cash at a canadian bank , i will speak with the relevant operations / credit person ( perhaps lori and / or cheryl dawes ) and have them contact you .
please let me know if you need further assistance with respect to this matter .

derek - please find out what enmax ' s credit requirements are for a guarantor , as well as explain the process of holding cash at a canadian bank . previously , when we tried to post cash for a c $ 600 security requirement at enmax ( calgary ) , they wouldn ' t accept it and required a letter of credit . we need verification that posting cash is not a problem and we need to understand the process . once we have answers to these questions , we can determine how to proceed .

"executive summary
? senator keeley spearheads a new "" plan b ""
? state to offer little aid in pg this announcement could come this afternoon . if it is not this afternoon , it will be later this week . sources report the republicans were working with keeley , but then felt shut out of the process , so they developed a plan of their own ( a lightly publicized point last week ) . however , sources believe that the plan b is very likely to have enough republican support to pass the assembly . the senate will likely be a much tougher fight , but opposition to the plan remains pessimistic that they will be able to stop it . the senate appears likely to broaden the base of people who would have to pay the dedicated rate component , which will be unpopular . borrowing from elements of the joe nation and florez "" plan b ' s , "" keeley ' s new plan is said to :
? set up a dedicated rate component for socal to deal with part of their undercollect . this dedicated rate component would apply more to "" high - end customers . "" where the line would be drawn between who would pay and who would not is still subject to negotiation . the size of the dedicated rate component is also subject to negotiation . socal has suggested $ 3 m for 10 to 12 years . note , sources report that at this time , a dedicated rate component for socal to pay for power going forward is not included in the plan b that will be announced . the assembly is not certain whether this additional dedicated rate component will be needed . if the bond issuance is enough to cover the cost of power purchases , no dedicated rate component for forward purchases will be needed . by 2003 and 2004 , enough additional generation should be online that power prices should be low . therefore , the key question becomes what will be the cost of power in 2002 ? if the cost of power is high , rates may have to be increased at that time for socal to continue operating .
? the state would make a secured loan ( secured against the transmission assets ) to socal to pay back the remainder of the undercollect . this loan would be paid back by socal granting the government a lower rate of return on the transmission system for a period of 10 to 15 years . this provides an incentive for socal to sell its transmission system to the state , since it would not be making as much money from the system . were this to happen , the value would be credited toward the loan .
? in return , the state would receive the withdrawal with prejudice of the filed rate doctrine case . also , socal would reduce the price of native power generation . finally , business customers ( including those that would have to pay the dedicated rate component ) would have the right to apply for direct access to power .
if this plan is passed , ( better than 50 / 50 chance - as reported earlier ) the constitutional challenge from michael sturmwasser is still likely to go forward . this is because sturmwasser is chiefly concerned with the fact that the plan results in a retroactive rate increase to pay socal ' s undercollect . sources believe it is likely that socal will eventually sell its transmission assets to the state if this plan is passed . therefore these assets would become municipal , making the reduction in the puc ' s authority constitutional .
legislature leaves pg & e to throws of bankruptcy
today , there have been discussions concerning pg & e regarding "" plan b "" and the legislature . currently , the legislature is not considering offering keeley ' s "" plan b "" solution to pg & e . if the plan b mentioned above passes the senate , it is more likely that the state will purchase pg & e out of bankruptcy . both the assembly and the senate leadership are talking seriously about purchasing pg & e out of bankruptcy , though the republicans remain strongly opposed . the state then , would likely sell off pieces of pg & e ( except for the transmission assets , which it would retain ) .",NO_IGNORE

attacks highlight enron ' s value
by lisa sanders
3 : 02 am et oct 4 , 2001
houston ( cbs . mw ) - - in the wake of the sept . 11 terrorist attacks , one
of the few places to buy or sell jet fuel was an online market
maintained by enron .
the attacks highlighted the houston company ' s strength as a manager of
risk during periods of heightened uncertainty . through its trading
centers , the company gives customers a way to hedge against volatility
in oil , natural gas , and electricity markets , as well as other
commodities .
although the company lost one employee aboard one of the hijacked
planes and closed its operations on the day of the attacks , its trading
activity resumed the next day .
by coming back online so fast , "" we made the decision to provide some
stability in the market , "" said vance meyer , an enron spokesman . "" the
customers really appreciated the fact that we were there , providing a
place for them to maintain and adjust their positions in the market . ""
in a financial sense , enron ( ene ) didn ' t suffer , meyer said . but
employees at the enron building in downtown houston were badly shaken .
nick humber , who worked for enron ' s wind energy business , died aboard a
los angeles bound flight that crashed into the world trade center .
"" we have offices in washington and new york , and people who had friends
that died or were affected in some way , "" meyer said "" we also had traders
who were on the phone with people in the world trade center when the
planes hit . ""
the decision to temporarily halt commodity trading on the new york
mercantile exchange in the wake of the attacks "" may have increased
volatility , a boon to the group , "" said bob christensen , analyst at
fac / equities . companies that can defray volatility by helping customers
manage their energy costs should be seeing a lot of business , he said .
managing risk is what enron does best , market players say . and that
strength should help the company going forward as u . s . businesses try to
recover from the impact of september 11 . through its enrononline
platform , the company buys and sells commodities at volumes totaling
about $ 3 billion a day , meyer said .
"" the world at large has become more risk averse , and enron , which is in
the business of risk mitigation , should benefit from that , "" said glen
hilton , senior analyst and portfolio manager for the montgomery new
power fund , which has a stake in enron . "" with energy risk and prices
potentially going up , they ' ll be the first number on many cfos ' speed
dial . ""
other companies do what enron does , but it ' s the best positioned to
succeed because of its status as the leader in natural gas and power
trading , measured in terms of volume . duke energy ( duk ) is the
next - largest competitor , but it has one - third of enron ' s volume .
high profile departure
that ' s a good place to be for a company whose stock price has been on
the skids since last year , though it grew 151 percent on the top line in
2000 . other problems notwithstanding , including its money - losing
broadband business and its failure to sell the oregon utility portland
general electric , enron ' s largest black eye came in mid - august when
jeffrey skilling , chief executive since february , resigned abruptly .
john hammerschmidt , senior portfolio manager of the turner new energy
and power technology fund , said he "" freaked out "" when skilling left and
managers immediately divested the turner large - cap portfolios of enron
holdings . despite its status as a growth player , turner had re - entered
the stock in june after a long absence because of valuation . at the
time , enron was trading in the mid to high $ 40 s .
"" this is a premier company and a premier industry , "" he said , adding
that he believed then that the market had priced rumors into the stock .
one of the rumors was that enron was about to take a big loss from being
long on power when power prices were collapsing , hammerschmidt said .
that has not materialized .
whatever the problems were , hammerschmidt said , he felt them to be
manageable . when skilling walked out , hammerschmidt began to believe
some of the rumors might be true .
"" in our experience , when somebody in power leaves for no reason ,
there ' s uncertainty and uncertainty makes growth guys real nervous , "" he
said .
management continuity
now he ' s looking to get back in . enron , he said , works in both down and
up markets .
"" enron ' s earnings are more solid today than they ' ve ever been . . . and
they ' re valuable because we ' re becoming a digital economy , "" he said . "" we
need high - quality power , and local power plants have trouble providing
reliability . enron is focused on guaranteeing people quality power in
times of stress on the system . ""
of course there ' s still the issue about trusting management . after
skilling left , enron promoted greg whalley to president and chief
operating officer and mark frevert to vice chairman .
"" you cannot expect ( whalley and frevert ) to articulate the enron vision
the way jeffrey did , "" christensen said . "" they may grow into it . ""
on the upside , skilling predecessor ken lay , who wall street credits
with building enron into a powerhouse , is back at the helm , and he has
promised to remain at the post until a solid succession plan is in
place .
"" we have a great deal of confidence in mr . ken lay as he was the
original architect of ene ' s ( and for that matter the entire industry ' s )
tremendous transformation for the past decade , "" merrill lynch stated in
a research report the day after skilling left enron .
what ' s more : "" ken lay has promised more transparency at enron , more
insight into how the company makes money , which will help , "" hilton said .
"" trying to forecast enron ' s earnings is difficult . ""
christensen said that a "" lack of data and clarity in regard "" to enron ' s
wholesale operations has been an issue in the past . enron has promised
to provide more information when it reports its third - quarter results on
october 16 .
ultimately , only time will assuage investors ' concerns . but with the
prospects that enron has , the stock is a deal right now , hammerschmidt
said .
"" i don ' t know what gets people back , but buy enron at $ 25 , and in a
year , you ' re making money , "" he said . "" i can see the stock getting back
to $ 50 in a blink . """,NO_IGNORE

"note : the ferc meeting is today . see the link below that can be checked for
updates .
enron ' s lay urges bold solutions to power market woes
as the federal energy regulatory commission prepared to weigh in this morning
with the federal government ' s answer to california ' s be - deviled power market ,
free market advocates issued last minute warnings against taking the price
cap route espoused by the cal - iso . ferc ' s meeting is scheduled to start at 9
am est . ( check http : / / intelligencepress . com this morning for updates )
in a letter fired off to ferc chairman james j . hoecker yesterday , enron ceo
kenneth lay urged the commission to find a fix for the underlying structural
problems in the power market rather than follow the steps of policy makers
who have placed "" price cap ' band aids ' over hemorrhaging wounds . ""
lay told hoecker the power market is "" halfway across a busy street in its
transition from monopoly to competition . it can ' t stand where it is . "" he said
ferc has to make a choice between falling into the "" same trap of political
expediency as california ' s iso , leaving the nation ' s electric system in the
lurch from one crisis to the next , [ o ] r it can take a big step toward
fundamental structural reform . ""
at the same time the electric power supply association ( epsa ) called on ferc
to issue an emergency cease and desist order prohibiting the cal - iso from
"" unilaterally implementing "" any changes to its current $ 250 / mwh price cap for
wholesale electricity purchases . in a motion filed monday , the marketer group
specifically asked the commission to bar the cal - iso board of directors from
putting into effect its decision to impose a fiendishly complex
load - differentiated price cap of $ 100 or less during the off - peak season
effective nov . 3 . the plan was designed by the state ' s main utility consumer
group ( see daily gpi , oct . 30 ) . in addition , the epsa urged ferc to "" state
explicitly "" that the cal - iso does not have the authority to impose or extend
price or bid caps , unless expressly authorized to do so by the commission .
the cal - iso ' s current authority to set price caps expires on nov . 15 .
lay said the cal - iso ' s complicated new formula caps prices below the cost of
gas - fired generation , "" making obvious errors such as failing to take into
account gas transportation costs between the henry hub and power plants in
california ; in doing so the bid cap makes it more economic for generators to
sell their gas supply , rather than use it to make electricity in california . ""
the new formula also forces the iso into the market to buy power on an ad hoc
basis "" to keep the lights on when the capped market fails to attract
sufficient supplies ( which it inevitably will do ) , "" lay said . in addition ,
the capped formula "" invites generators to shut in production , export power
out of state and deploy their turbines in other states or countries . ""
he noted that the iso ' s chairman voted against the measure while all of the
state ' s utilities voted for it "" presumably knowing full well that it simply
will not work . ""
california is "" just the latest failure of partial or compromised open
access , "" said lay . "" it ' s time for the commission to reject this approach .
"" the power industry - - - the nation ' s most essential industry - - - is mired in
the transition from regulated monopoly to open access and customer choice .
every step forward has been compromised out of concern for alienating one
vested interest or another . as a result , utilities are free to slow the
interconnection of new generation , withhold equal access to the transmission
system , favor their own sales over those of competitors , miscalculated
available transmission capacity , and exercise control over supposedly
' independent ' system operators and reliability organizations .
lay predicted that installing price caps for political expediency would
"" plunge markets into greater uncertainty and discourage new supplies and
conservation methods . . . ""
ferc has to complete the work that it started , said lay . it has to ensure
that all parties have equal and fair access to transmission by "" ending the
special priority for utility uses of the system . second , ferc must require
transmission owners to separate operation of the monopoly transmission assets
from their other businesses . third , ferc must take politics out of
transmission system operations by revising governance structures to ensure
independence . finally , ferc must end its reliance on shortsighted price caps
by putting in place the necessary reforms to allow these markets to operate
efficiently to encourage conservation and attract new supplies . ""
epsa said the cal - iso board "" acted in obvious disregard for the commission ' s
orderly processes . "" it "" cannot be permitted to make the commission ' s
decisions for it , or to alter so radically market rules , thereby injecting
more uncertainty and confusion in the market and subverting the process for
fashioning fair , effective and comprehensive remedies "" for california ' s
"" flawed "" electric markets , the group noted .
the epsa believes that any remedial actions taken by ferc with respect to the
california markets will be "" severely compromised "" if the cal - iso board ' s
imposition of new prices caps is allowed to take effect .

"my feedback :
philip has an excellent cv and background - - - phd coursework at university
of chicago , and work experience at long term capital ( hopefully he learned
something ) . his views are somewhat idealistic - - - his aim is to make
bid - offers in any product , and he could not really address how he would
handle illiquidity . nevertheless , if bryan needs traders , he can fit the
role .
zak seemed somewhat unfocused . he has worked on a variety of projects , but
does not have any specific view in mind as to what he would like to do . he
seemed very academically oriented , and might be hard to communicate and work
with . i do not see him working in the trenches , and i do not see him leading
the group either . he would be a good person to brainstorm ideas with .

made this morning by senate majority leader tom daschle when asked
about the collapse of enron corp . :
` ` we ' re certainly going to try to find answers to
the questions involving the collapse of enron . i don ' t know that
anybody knows yet just how this happened and how it happened so
quickly .
` ` i think we need to find as much information as is possible
and make some assessment about whether it ' s indicative of energy
in a larger context and if it is , what we ought to do about it .
but clearly it raises some very serious questions . ' '
enron troubles hit houston office market ; tower project delayed

enron troubles hit houston office market ; tower project delayed
houston , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - trammell crow co . delayed
construction of a $ 108 million office development in downtown
houston , the first real estate project in the city to suffer the
fallout from enron ' s financial troubles .
trammell crow delayed groundbreaking on the planned 34 - story
tower until at least next year , said leah rogers , a trammell crow
spokeswoman . construction was to have started next week .
` ` given the national economic uncertainty and the uncertainty
associated with the future availability of class ` a ' space
springing from the recent events at enron , we have decided to
delay our construction start until future visibility improves , ' '
matt khourie , who heads trammell crow ' s houston development
operations , said in a statement .
enron , the largest u . s . energy trader , may have to file for
bankruptcy protection and liquidate assets after dynegy inc .
abandoned its proposed purchase of the company , investors and
analysts said . with enron expected to give most of the 3 million
square feet it occupies in houston , developers will have a harder
time filling projects , forcing rental rates down , brokers said .
about 2 million square feet of enron ' s space is in the city ' s
downtown , where trammell crow ' s ballpark place project was
planned . the project was to include apartments and retail space ,
and sit next to enron field , home to the major league baseball
team houston astros , according to the houston chronicle , which
reported the delay earlier .
houston has 4 projects under construction , including a 40 -
story , 1 . 17 - million - square - foot tower being built by enron next to
its current headquarters . the projects are mainly being built for
power companies , said peyton collins , head of property broker
insignia / esg ' s houston office .
` ` the downtown market is 5 percent vacant and if you look
five years out , with all the space that ' s coming in line , vacancy
rates could double , ' ' said collins .
other houston office projects underway include an 800 , 000 -
square - foot building in which reliant resources will lease 550 , 000
square feet , and a 600 , 000 - square - foot tower , half of which will
be occupied by calpine corp . , according to insignia .

( updates with financing details in second paragraph and

purchase , new york , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - newpower holdings
inc . , a venture formed by enron corp . to compete with traditional
natural - gas and electric utilities , said it has enough cash and
credit to run through the second quarter .
the company is negotiating with lenders for $ 50 million for
next year and another $ 50 million in 2003 , spokeswoman gael doar
said . newpower , 44 percent owned by enron , may need money to buy
gas for winter inventories next year , she said .
newpower said a possible enron bankruptcy filing probably
won ' t affect its earnings . the purchase , new york - based company
said it can meet its credit obligations to enron and utilities and
will continue to deliver to customers .
newpower had 805 , 000 customers at the end of the third
quarter and said it expects to have 840 , 000 to 860 , 000 by the end
of the year . most electricity customers are in texas . georgia is

pennsylvania and elsewhere .

nymex tells members enron trades must be approved ( updatel )
( adds margin increases in fourth - fifth paragraphs . )
new york , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - new york mercantile exchange
president j . robert collins told floor members they could not
accept orders from enron corp . unless they receive written
authorization from an exchange clearing member .
a fax from collins to member firms today said the order was
effective immediately and that it would ` ` remain in effect until
further notice from the exchange . ' '
clearing members are companies that guarantee transactions on
the exchange , which trades energy and metals futures and options .
the exchange yesterday said it will raise margins on its
natural gas and crude oil futures contracts at the close of
trading today . margins are deposits traders must make with the
exchange when buying or selling futures contracts to ensure
obligations will be met .
while the exchange gave no reason for the increase , the
decision followed a day of wide changes in natural gas prices . the
swings began after dynegy inc . abandoned plans to purchase enron ,
once the biggest gas trader . traders grew concerned that enron
might be forced into bankruptcy .
enron metals close to finding a buyer , administrators say
2001 - 11 - 29 13 : 32 ( new york )
enron metals close to finding a buyer , administrators say
london , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . ' s metals unit , one
of the biggest traders on the london metal exchange , is close to
being sold , its administrator said , an accord that would end an 18 -
month foray into markets for copper and similar products .
possible buyers include hsbc holdings plc , glencore
international ag and the current management of the company ,
traders and analysts speculated . officials at the companies
couldn ' t immediately be reached for comment .
` ` there is already very serious interest in enron ' s metal
business , and negotiations are expected to lead to a successful
deal ' ' soon , said tony lomas , a pricewaterhousecoopers
administrator for enron in europe . ` ` our primary focus will be on
the large physical assets and trading position of the group . ' '
traders and analysts have speculated that enron metals would
be sold since dynegy inc . agreed earlier this month to buy enron
corp . for $ 23 billion . after that accord collapsed yesterday , the
metals unit seemed slated for a sale , analysts said .
enron agreed to buy the business , formerly mg plc , for $ 445
million in may of last year . mg itself was the metals - trading unit
of germany ' s metallgesellschaft ag and a century - old operation
upon which that german construction , engineering and trading
company was built .
it is one of just 11 floor traders on the london metal
exchange , the world ' s biggest metals bourse . enron earned
commissions though brokering trades there , charged rent at its
warehouses owned by henry bath & son ltd . and speculated on the
direction of metals prices .
declining market
the former chief executive of metallgesellschaft , heinz
schimmelbusch , in an interview earlier this month denied
speculation that his pennsylvania - based safeguard international
fund lp was interested in buying enron or any metals - trading
operation .
hsbc , europe ' s biggest bank by market value , said last month
it ' s considering a plan to add trading of industrial metals such
as copper and aluminum to its precious - metals trading operation to
meet demand from its customers .
any interest from glencore may stem from its desire to expand
its existing operations , said mike price , head of mining and
metals at societe generale , which is itself a so - called ring
dealer , or floor trader , on the lme .
whoever buys enron metals ` ` has to be somebody pretty
substantial , ' ' price said . if the current management hopes to be
the buyer , ` ` they would need to find somebody with deep pockets . ' '
the new owner of enron metals will be entering the metals
market at a time when copper prices have declined 15 percent this
year and aluminum prices are 7 percent down as demand dropped from
users such as aircraft makers and electronics companies amid
slowing economies .
the declining prices have led n . m . rothschild & sons , a
member of the lme , to quit base metals trading and prompted
scotiamoccata , a metals - trading unit of canada ' s bank of nova
scotia to leave the lme ring .
the departure of scotiamoccata reduced the number of ring
dealers to 11 and raised doubts about the future of open - outcry
trading at the exchange . the lme is promoting less - expensive
electronic trading .
german bank enron exposure between $ 9 million and $ 100 million
2001 - 11 - 29 13 : 32 ( new york )
german bank enron exposure between $ 9 million and $ 100 million
frankfurt , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - dresdner bank ag , which is
owned by allianz ag , said its exposure to enron corp . is about
$ 100 million .
deutsche bank ag and commerzbank ag said their exposure to
enron amounts to a ` ` double - digit ' ' million euros amount .
europe ' s largest bank has an exposure ` ` significantly ' ' below

for deutsche bank .
commerzbank ' s exposure is more than 10 million euros and less
than 50 million euros , spokesman peter pietsch said .

the largest u . s . energy trader , may file for bankruptcy
protection after dynegy inc . yesterday abandoned its proposed
merger with enron , forcing enron to liquidate assets to pay some
of its $ 15 billion in publicly held debt .
enron corp . is poised to file largest - ever bankruptcy case
2001 - 11 - 29 14 : 04 ( new york )
enron corp . is poised to file largest - ever bankruptcy case
washington , nov . 29 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . is poised to
file the largest bankruptcy reorganization in history after dynegy
inc . scuttled plans to acquire the energy trader that is saddled
with more than $ 15 billion in debt .
enron , with less than $ 2 billion in cash as of last week ,
must pay $ 690 million to lenders by mid - december and is
responsible for another $ 3 . 9 billion in debt owed by affiliated
partnerships .
the houston - based company ' s collapse was underscored by new
restrictions on its operations . the new york mercantile exchange
barred floor members from accepting orders from enron without
special written authorization , and the company ' s internet trading
was reduced from about 30 commodities to three products .
a bankruptcy filing by enron would top texaco inc . ' s record
$ 35 . 9 billion case in 1987 , with creditors lining up to claim
what ' s left of the company ' s more than $ 61 billion in assets .
` ` it ' s a black hole , ' ' said gary hindes , managing director of
deltec asset management llc , which has no investment in enron .
` ` until the forensic accountants can get in there and sort things
out , you just don ' t know what enron ' s worth . ' '
duke energy corp . , j . p . morgan chase & co . , williams cos . and
a dozen other companies say they may lose more than $ 1 billion
combined from enron ' s collapse . electricity and natural gas
companies said enron owed them almost $ 600 million as of
yesterday .
in london , was appointed administrator
of enron ' s european holding company and some of its operating
companies , a step other companies have taken before filing chapter
11 papers in the u . s .
enron shares have lost more than $ 26 billion in market value
in the last six months .
lawyers
enron has hired the law firm weil gotshal & manges llp , which
has the nation ' s largest bankruptcy practice , and the blackstone
group lp investment banking firm . arthur newman , head of
restructuring at blackstone , said his firm was retained but
declined to comment further .
chapter 11 would let enron officials continue to control the
company while negotiating a recovery plan with creditors . a
provision of u . s . bankruptcy law automatically blocks debt -
collection efforts , lawsuits and other actions against the
company .
` ` a chapter 11 filing can be a great thing for a cash - starved
company being attacked from all sides , ' ' said nancy rapoport , dean
of the university of houston law center .
thousands affected
an enron bankruptcy would affect thousands of people ,
including the company ' s 21 , 000 employees , its customers ,
suppliers , investors and other creditors . the court - supervised
recovery process would give enron a chance to change strategies
and fix mistakes . it might take years to complete and may end in
the company ' s liquidation .
in addition to its energy trading operation , enron operates a
nationwide gas pipeline system spanning 25 , 000 miles . it also owns
portland general electric , which generates and distributes power
to about 725 , 000 customers in the pacific northwest . the company ' s
enron broadband services is building a global fiber - optic
communications network .
chapter 11 reorganization lets companies abandon onerous
contracts and unprofitable leases .
` ` every bad business deal enron got into they ' ll walk away
from , ' ' said peter chapman , a distressed - debt investor who also
publishes newsletters on high - profile bankruptcy reorganizations .
recovery
the goal in chapter 11 is a recovery plan that allows a
company to pay creditors and come out of bankruptcy . a plan
typically must be approved by a majority of creditors representing
two - thirds of a company ' s debts . then a company would ask a
bankruptcy judge for final approval .
the recovery plan divides a company ' s value among various
classes of creditors . under a hierarchy set by the u . s . bankruptcy
code , secured creditors - - those with collateral backing their
claims - - are paid ahead of unsecured creditors , such as
bondholders and suppliers .
financial advisers to creditors and companies in large
bankruptcies say a chapter 11 recovery plan for enron would be
particularly difficult to produce .
` ` you have a host of intangible assets combined with a morass
of contingent liabilities creating a potential witches ' brew of a
bankruptcy , ' ' said jeff werbalowsky of houlihan lokey howard &
zukin , an investment banking firm that has been contacted for
advice by enron bondholders .
shareholders
enron ' s shareholders are likely to lose all of their
investment in a chapter 11 case because they would be last in line
to get paid .
enron shares fell 20 cents , or 33 percent , to 41 cents in
afternoon trading . the shares traded at $ 54 . 54 on june 4 . the
company said this morning it was evaluating whether it will pay a
scheduled 12 . 5 - cent quarterly dividend on dec . 20 .
enron ' s bond prices reflect the uncertainty about the
company ' s value . the company ' s 6 . 4 percent notes that mature in
2006 were unchanged at about 22 cents on the dollar , traders said .
at that price the notes yield 53 percent .
some recovery for enron creditors in a bankruptcy case may
come from lawsuits , said russell a . belinsky , an investment banker
with chanin capital partners , which also has been approached for
advice by enron bondholders .
` ` there ' s a lot of juicy legal issues , ' ' said belinsky .
potential targets include enron ' s accounting firm and its officers
and directors .
` ` disentangling all the pieces in a reorganization is going
to be a painstaking job , ' ' he said .
liability
dynegy might face some liability for canceling its purchase
of enron . dynegy invoked terms of the buyout agreement that gave
it the right to purchase an enron natural gas pipeline if the
takeover fell apart . dynegy received the right to the pipeline in
exchange for a $ 1 . 5 billion investment in enron by chevrontexaco
corp . , which owns one - fourth of dynegy .
enron might use bankruptcy to prevent dynegy from walking
away from the buyout and claiming ownership to the pipeline .
the dynegy acquisition , valued at $ 23 billion when it was
proposed on nov . 9 , collapsed as bankers failed to raise the $ 1 . 5
billion enron needed to operate until the deal was completed . the
lack of funds and a credit downgrade contributed to dynegy ' s
decision .
bankers led by j . p . morgan chase & co . vice chairman james b .
lee tried for two weeks to raise the cash enron needed . investors
turned them down because of heightened concern enron wouldn ' t be
able to pay its debts .
three credit - rating agencies yesterday cut enron ' s credit
rating to junk status , triggering an acceleration of the company ' s
debt obligations .
unraveling
enron ' s unraveling began in october after it said
shareholders ' equity was reduced by $ 1 . 2 billion because of the
way the company accounted for outside partnerships it created . the
announcement prompted lawsuits and an investigation by the u . s .
securities and exchange commission , and enron ended up restating
earnings for almost five years .
as shares plunged , enron ' s trading partners lost confidence
the company would have the cash to pay bills . trading partners
such as mirant corp . either demanded more collateral to trade or
restricted trading with the company .
` ` the situation is dire , ' ' said deltec ' s hindes . ` ` no one ' s
going to trade with enron right now because you could wind up
being an unsecured creditor tomorrow . ' '
enron ' s overseas assets could complicate bankruptcy

new york - ( dow jones ) - as enron corp . ( ene ) teeters on the edge of insolvency , its creditors , power industry players and even foreign governments are angling to lay claim to the company ' s assets .
in an example of how far the ripples are being felt , the brazilian government said thursday it ' s legally entitled to seize enron ' s assets in that country if the u . s . energy titan files for bankruptcy .
the houston - based company has more than $ 60 billion in assets , a little more than 10 % of which are considered "" non - core "" or located overseas . indeed , of enron ' s 10 , 453 megawatts in total power production , 8339 mw are generated internationally .
as it established a presence in dozens of countries , enron also diversified into oil and gas exploration and production , power generation , and even non - energy related businesses such as forest products , metals and steel , broadband and credit evaluation systems .
although enron ' s non - core and global forays haven ' t on the whole been profitable , there is value in some of the hard assets .
and while it ' s not clear whether or how claims by foreign governments on enron assets would be honored , it ' s certain the company ' s myriad overseas holdings will further addle what would likely be a vastly complex bankruptcy proceeding .
the following is an overview of a number of those holdings outside the north american continent , according to some of the most recent data provided by the company , which didn ' t , however , specify the extent of its equity interests or operational control in the majority of the assets listed .
approximately 70 % of enron ' s assets outside north america and europe are located in central and south america and the caribbean :
- - - brazil : enron controls electricity distributor elektro eletricidade e servico sa ( e . eko ) , which was acquired in 1998 for brrl . 479 billion ( $ 1 = brr 2 . 48 ) . it also owns two gas - fired thermoelectric plants : eletrobolt , with a capacity of 380 megawatts , and cuiaba , with a 480 - mw capacity .
enron also owns important stakes in natural gas distributor companhia distribuidora de gas do rio de janeiro ( e . cdr ) , or ceg , and its smaller unit ceg - rio .
in late april , brazil ' s oil giant petroleo brasileiro ( pbr ) , or petrobras , agreed to pay $ 240 million for the stake enron owns in ceg . petrobras agreed to buy the 25 . 38 % stake the u . s . energy group owns in ceg as well as the 33 . 75 % stake enron has in ceg - rio . the deal is still seen closing in the next few days .
- - - puerto rico : enron has been poised to sell in the weeks ahead a 49 % interest in the 507 mw ecoelectrica power plant and liquified natural gas terminal for about $ 250 million .
it ' s also involved in a 20 , 000 metric ton liquefied petroleum gas storage terminal and the san juan gas distribution company , which has a capacity to carry approximately 400 , 000 cubic feet a day .
- - - bolivia : enron is an operator on the bolivian side of the 3 , 000 kilometer bolivia - to - brazil natural gas pipeline , and holds a small 4 % interest on the brazilian side .
- - - argentina : enron has an interest in transportadora de gas del sur , a 5 , 005 kilometer pipeline .
- - - venezuela : enron , in cooperation with vengas , is involved in a leading transporter and distributor of lpg , among other assets .
- - - colombia : enron has stakes in the centragas pipeline , a 578 km natural gas transmission system , and promigas , a top natural gas company .
- - - panama : enron holds a 355 mw electricity generation plant .
- - - guatemala : enron has two power plants with combined generating capacity of 234 mw .
- - - dominican republic : enron has a 185 mw power facility .
the company also has a sizeable footprint in asia , particularly in india :
- - - india : about 14 % of enron ' s international assets are located in india , home to its mammoth $ 3 billion dabhol power project , which has a generation capacity of 2184 mw .
enron is also poised to sell its offshore india oil 201 - 938 - 2226 ; charles . roth @ dowjones . com

usa : ice electronic energy trade soars on enron woes .

reuters english news service
( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
new york , nov 29 ( reuters ) - the intercontinental exchange ( ice ) , an atlanta - based electronic energy and metals marketplace , said on thursday that trade on its system in late november was up 65 percent from october .
ice has been setting new trading records in recent weeks , as concerns over energy trader enron corp . ' s crumbling credit rating diverted on - line business to the exchange .
enron suspended operations of enrononline , ice ' s main rival for internet - based trading , on wednesday after standard & poor ' s cut enron ' s credit rating to "" junk "" status , killing a potential takeover by dynegy inc . .
enron , which said it has no plans to permanently dismantle its electronic trading system , said it reopened enrononline thursday to allow parties to unwind outstanding positions .
until this month , enron was by far the nation ' s largest trader in north american natural gas and electricity , with industry analysts estimating it was involved in some 25 percent of all daily trade in those markets .
in addition to increased volumes , ice has also seen a big jump in the number of users tapping into the system , up 30 percent from october , the exchange said in a statement .
"" over the past couple of weeks we have experienced an increase in total volumes and registered users , "" said jeffrey sprecher , chief executive officer of ice .
"" we believe the inherent credit concerns in the otc ( over - the - counter ) market have spawned interest in a many - to - many trading platform as opposed to a one - to - many platform .
sprecher also said ice would continue to look for ways to expand its trading platform to accommodate new participants .
as an open - access marketplace , intercontinental exchange now has over 400 commodity trading firms participating .
the ice electronic trading system is now installed on over 7 , 500 desktops worldwide , a 7 percent gain in the past two weeks .
products traded on ice include natural gas , power , crude oil and refined products , precious metals and emissions allowances .
intercontinental exchange has offices in new york , houston , chicago , london and singapore and is owned by over 100 energy and metals traders , brokers and bankers .

london , nov 29 ( reuters ) - british day - ahead electricity prices slumped on thursday as traders dumped power onto the market after cutting ties with troubled enron .
day - ahead electricity was trading down to 15 pounds per megawatt hour from 26 . 5 pounds on wednesday .
"" certain parties have cut lines with counter parties and have ended up having to dump electricity on the market , "" said one trader .
the electricity flooding the prompt market is power which would have gone to enron and is likely to be generated from plants which cannot easily be switched off , such as nuclear power stations .
enron ' s european business was placed into administration on thursday as its parent stands on the brink of bankruptcy after a rescue deal with smaller rival dynegy fell apart .

us power , gas markets remain orderly despite enron exit

new york - ( dow jones ) - trading in u . s . natural gas and electricity markets generally remained orderly thursday , and price movements continued to be muted , despite the exit of one - time market leader enron corp . ( ene ) .
some gas markets , however , saw more volatility as a result of enron ' s absence , traders said , and some electricity prices seemed stronger than justified by fundamentals , perhaps a result of buying by traders covering their exposure to enron . the moves weren ' t dramatic .
"" it ' s almost business as usual , "" one power trader said .
enron wasn ' t presenting a full range of prices on its internet - based platform enrononline thursday , although traders said enron was briefly making markets for some products .
traders , who for the most part aren ' t doing business with the company , attributed the activity to last - minute efforts by some energy companies to flatten their positions with enron and the energy giant ' s own efforts to close its positions .
"" there ' s a lot of unwinding going on , "" a trader said .
the new york mercantile exchange , the world ' s largest energy futures exchange , advised its floor members thursday morning not to accept orders placed directly to the trading floor by enron or enron affiliates without written authorization from a clearing member carrying an enron account .
the exit of a company that once accounted for a quarter of the north american power and gas markets has produced substantial changes in the way business is done in the energy markets .
traders used to transacting on enrononline were spending more time on the phone or turning to platforms like that run by , an electronic marketplace founded by a consortium of energy and financial companies . traders accustomed to looking to enrononline for pricing guidance were left to figure out the market for themselves .
the result was abnormally high volatility in the physical gas markets , particularly on gas for delivery in the next month , a trader said .
gas for delivery in december at southern california ' s topak hub was trading in a range of $ 1 . 95 to $ 2 . 55 per million british thermal units , the trader said . december gas at the san juan basin was trading at $ 1 . 70 - $ 2 . 44 .
"" traders aren ' t sure where they should be trading , "" the trader said .

san francisco , nov 29 ( reuters ) - beleaguered energy giant enron corp . said on thursday it had reopened its widely used electronic trading system to allow parties to unwind outstanding positions .
the company also said it has no plans to permanently dismantle its enrononline ( eol ) system , which until this month was by far the most liquid marketplace for trading north american electricity and natural gas .
"" enrononline is now available to our customers to transact only in order to provide a means to manage enron credit exposure , "" a message posted on the trading system said .
the message warned that "" while transactions may be available , customers entering into transactions should carefully evaluate their positions and enron ' s current credit status before transacting . ""
enron spokesman eric thode confirmed enrononline - which recently accounted for up to 60 percent of enron ' s business - restarted operations late wednesday .
the internet - based eol trading platform was shut earlier wednesday after credit rating agencies cut enron ' s debt to "" junk "" status .
thode also said the company had "" no plans "" to cease operations on enrononline after parties have closed all outstanding positions .
the system also carries products for trading various commodities like metals , pulp and paper .
enron is teetering on the brink of bankruptcy after a rescue deal with its smaller rival , dynegy inc . , fell apart on wednesday .

berlin - ( dow jones ) - while some european mutual funds may be stuck holding enron inc . ( ene ) shares or bonds , their exposure appears fairly limited , with a number of fund companies saying they already sold off their holdings in recent months .
nevertheless , a few funds said they had some exposure in stock or bonds to the company , which stopped most trading wednesday after standard & poor ' s downgraded its credit rating to "" junk "" and dynegy inc . ( dyn ) abandoned plans for a buyout .
fund manger helle bendorff with bg invest in copenhagen said at the end of october , bg invest ' s international corporate bond fund had 6 . 1 million kroner , or 3 . 2 % , invested in enron corporate bonds , out of a total fund of dkkl 95 million ( $ 1 = dkk 8 . 3652 ) .
"" naturally when something like this happens anyone can see it will take its toll on returns , "" said bendorff . however , she wouldn ' t give further details .
enron ' s 4 3 / 8 bonds dated 2005 were trading around 20 cents to the dollar thursday , down from over 50 cents before the buyout fell through . the collapse of the dynegy deal leaves enron bondholders holding about $ 13 billion in debt versus an unknown base of assets .
analysts widely expect enron to file for insolvency protection , and its liquidation value will be the focus for bondholders . bondholders are therefore more likely to get something back than investors who are left holding stocks .
in contrast with u . s . counterparts , most european stock funds ' exposure appears fairly low , however , and any hit to their value was probably already taken in the last months .
fund managers and spokespeople at a number of european fund houses that had been known to have holdings in enron shares in the past said they sold off those assets in recent months and weeks .
a spokesman at dutch funds company ohra beleggingen beheer bv said the fund sold its enron holdings at the end of october . they had comprised around 4 . 7 % of its eur 20 million new energy fund and were also included in some other funds , according to funds tracking company morningstar . he said they took a loss on the investment , but stressed they still unwound their holdings on time .
a fund manager at denmark ' s uni - invest said the firms electronic business unit trust had sold off its holdings in enron prior to the current troubles . as of the end of september the unit trust had held 3 . 6 % of its assets in enron stock . the size of the unit trust is dkk 585 million , the manager said .
dresdner bank ' s dit funds arm also sold off all its enron holdings in its energie fonds after the company ' s third - quarter earnings report , a spokesman said , as did ubs ' ag ' s ef - energy fund .
european energy funds tend to be rather small , so even if the fund is highly exposed , it ' s unlikely to have any market impact . the largest energy funds are only several hundred million euros , for example .
in the u . s . , the picture was somewhat different .
enron may have been held by some major u . s . funds , according to the funds ' most recent securities and exchange commission filings . those include fmr corp . ' s ( x . fin ) fidelity investments , stilwell financial inc . ' s ( sv ) janus capital corp . , alliance capital management ( ac ) and putnam investments . vanguard group inc . ( x . vgi ) held the stock in various portfolios , including its giant passively managed index funds , according to its filings .
the $ 11 billion alliance premier growth fund had about 4 % of its assets in enron shares as of sept . 30 , according to morningstar . based on the sept . 30 filing , the fund ' s stake had dropped in value by about $ 445 million through wednesday . a spokeswoman for janus said the company ' s mercury fund , which had 3 . 6 % of its assets invested in enron stock on april 30 , had disposed of all its enron shares by mid - november .
many of the stock funds in europe that are still holding enron funds also reduced their weightings considerably in recent months , according to their representatives .
a spokesman for u . k . - based investec said the company is still holding some enron stock , but wouldn ' t give specific data . morningstar listed the global privatization fund and the wired index fund as holders of enron stock , but investec ' s web site doesn ' t list the funds in the top 10 holdings .
"" our enron positions in each of these funds is less than 3 % - it ' s a non - material exposure . we cut our loss positions about two months ago , and we were underweight even before that for a year now , "" he said . "" the wired index fund tracks the wired index ( a u . s . new - economy index ) and enron is a constituent of that , so our holding is the constituent portion . ""
separately , standard and poor ' s said enron will be removed from its sdow jones newswires ; 49 - 302888410

enron metals trading staff say bnp , coke metals , hsbc rumoured possible buyers
11 / 29 / 2001
afx news
( c ) 2001 by afp - extel news ltd
new york ( afx ) - enron corp ' s metal trading division has sparked some interest from potential buyers with rumours from the company ' s own trading floor putting bnp paribas , coke metals group , hsbc banking group and goldman sachs & co inc in the frame , an enron metals trader said .
he added that employees have not yet received any information from management on the future of the troubled energy giant following news from london this morning that enron ' s european office has gone into administration .
"" everybody showed up for work today , it ' s still a working entity but we ' ve had no word , no internal memos as yet , "" the employee told afx news . "" we ' re completely in the dark . ""
according to reports , an official from administrator has said there is strong interest in the company ' s metals trading division , sparking speculation within the company of potential acquirers , he said .
parties rumoured to be interested in acquiring the division include bnp paribas , coke metals , hsbc and goldman sachs .
"" enron still has a membership of the london metals exchange which is of interest to banks who want to get back into the business , "" said the employee , who requested anonymity .
"" it ' s not the only asset that would be of interest though . the pipeline and fact that ( enron ) has warehousing should be worth hundreds of millions of dollars . ""
enron , which employs a total of 21 , 000 people , has been flooded with phone calls all morning from customers seeking information on the company ' s plans .
"" for now , we ' re still optimistic that a solution will be found and we won ' t lose our jobs , "" said the employee .
analysts are expecting enron to file for bankruptcy protection after dynegy inc yesterday terminated their merger agreement and the company ' s ratings were reduced to junk status .
the stock , which lost 85 pct of its value yesterday , has been forced out of the s & p 500 .

usa : dynegy cites deterioration in enron operations .
11 / 29 / 2001
reuters english news service
( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
houston , nov 29 ( reuters ) - dynegy inc . chairman and chief executive chuck watson on thursday said disclosures by enron corp . of further deterioration in its operations led dynegy to pull out of a deal to acquire the beleaguered energy trading giant and keep it afloat .
a nov . 19 filing with regulators showed that enron faced insurmountable problems both in the long term and the short term , causing dynegy to invoke "" material adverse change "" clauses allowing it to pull out of its agreement to acquire enron , watson said in an interview with cnbc television .
announcements on wednesday by credit - rating agencies that they had downgraded enron debt to junk status also played a key role in dynegy ' s decision , he said .
watson said dynegy is confident that it will take control of enron ' s northern natural gas pipeline unit next month under a clause of the acquisition agreement that allowed it to keep the 16 , 500 miles of pipeline if the deal collapsed .
enron has said it will contest dynegy ' s claim to the pipeline .

( c ) reuters limited 2001 .
washington , nov 29 ( reuters ) - u . s . senate majority leader tom daschle said on thursday that congress should find out what brought one - time energy giant enron corp . to the brink of bankruptcy , and see if it has broader ramifications for the energy industry .
"" we certainly need to try to find answers to the questions involving the collapse of enron , "" the south dakota democrat told reporters .
"" i think we need to find as much information as possible , and make some assessments of whether it ' s indicative of energy in the larger context and if it is , what we ought to do about it . but clearly , it raises some very serious questions , "" daschle said .
activity at many enron units in more than 40 countries around the world ground to a halt this week . the global giant employs 21 , 000 people in operations ranging from marketing electricity and natural gas to delivering commodities such as metals , coal , pulp and paper .
house energy and commerce committee chairman billy tauzin said on wednesday he did not see a way for the government to try to rescue enron , which was near collapse after rival energy trader dynergy inc . pulled out of a deal to buy it .
"" i can ' t right now envision anything the government can do , other than encourage the parties who are discussing a merger to continue their efforts , "" said tauzin , a louisiana republican .

enron crisis hits four japanese money mgmt funds - nikkei

dow jones international news
( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . )
tokyo ( nikkei ) - - the reverberations of the crisis at u . s . energy trading giant enron corp . are starting to shake japanese investors , the nihon keizai shimbun reported in its friday morning edition .
with enron now on the edge of bankruptcy , money management funds managed by nikko asset management co . and three other fund companies fell below their par value of yl 0 , 000 thursday due to losses on enron bonds .
the money management funds have apparently fallen 0 . 5 % to 7 % under par value , a significant loss of principal given that the funds total more than y 3 trillion in size .
japan has experienced two previous cases of money management funds falling under their face value , but the losses were smaller in scale .
the four fund companies are being besieged with redemptions by nervous investors anxious to retrieve their money . nikko asset management , for example , has reportedly received requests for redemptions totaling more than yl trillion out of a total fund balance of y 2 . 7 trillion .
japan investment trust management co . and sumisei global investment trust management co . , two of the other firms hit by losses on enron bonds , also received redemption requests equivalent to nearly 30 % of total fund assets . the fourth firm affected was ufj partners asset management co .
jittery investors , meanwhile , are asking other fund companies , even those not affected by the enron crisis , to disclose their asset holdings in money management funds .
in response , shinko investment trust management co . has drawn up plans to send to brokers materials disclosing all holdings in its money management fund and a medium - term government bond investment fund .
daiwa asset management co . is also considering ways to beef up disclosure for what is the largest money management fund in the industry .
analysts and industry executives are expressing concern that the declines below the par value could cause investors to rethink the safety of money management funds . these funds have been marketed as ultrasafe investment vehicles and a good alternative to bank deposits when a cap on deposit insurance protection is reimposed in april next year . with interest rates continuing to languish at extremely low levels , some fund managers have been tempted to add riskier corporate bonds to their holdings in an attempt to pump up fund yields .
money management funds had more than yl 8 trillion in assets as of the end of october , accounting for about one - third of assets in all investment trusts .

enron bonds signal anticipated enron bankruptcy filing

dow jones capital markets report
( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . )
new york - ( dow jones ) - the corporate bond market is signaling its anticipation of an imminent bankruptcy filing by beleaguered energy services company enron corp . ( ene ) .
there is a 22 - 1 / 2 bid both for bonds maturing in 2003 and 2009 . and neither bid is with accrued interest .
the combination of the bonds trading without accrued interest , or flat , and the withering of the normal gap in price between shorter - and longer - dated maturities means the market believes "" the company is probably going into bankruptcy , "" said tom haag , senior analyst in charge of distressed securities , lutheran brotherhood , minneapolis .
by trading flat , investors are saying that they do not expect to receive any further interest payments from enron . and the sameness of price , regardless of maturity , signals that the market believes all the bonds will be treated the same in a bankruptcy proceeding , said haag .
normally , bond prices reflect greater risk of repayment for longer - dated maturities .
on wednesday , before standard & poor ' s and the two other major ratings agencies downgraded enron to speculative grade from investment grade , enron ' s 7 - 7 / 8 % coupon bonds maturing in 2003 were being offered at a price of $ 59 with accrued interest , traders said .
after the downgrades , prices fell into the 20 s but the bonds were still quoted with accrued interest , said harold rivkin , principal , h . rivkin 201 - 938 - 2008 ; michael . barr @ dowjones . com

"i am having trouble with the transport deal for the tenaska iv contracts on
lone star . we have deal 452491 in sitara for meter 20014804 at a $ 0 . 01
transport rate . we received the statement from txu lone star and it does not
agree with our deal . they are billing for meter 25000200 at $ 0 . 10 and meter
20014903 at $ 0 . 02 . these meters relate to the tenaska iv sale deal 384258
and the tenaska marketing deal 459898 , respectively . should our deal match
what txu is billing or is there another deal that i am missing ? i haven ' t
worked with transport very much , so i could be confused . i think we have
this problem with oct 2000 , also , but i have not reviewed it yet . i am going
to look at it this afternoon . tenaska iv has already reimbursed us for the
txu transport , so we will need to pay this next week .
also , now that we have the actuals for nov 2000 , we need to update the demand
fees to reflect the correct volumes . barring any changes , i have listed the
adjustments below and attached my spreadsheet . the unify adjustments will be
over by about $ 20 . 00 from the spreadsheet . i thought it would be better have
the cleburne desk at zero , than to leave a balance .

excited about this event .

question 1 ) the investments in calme and apachi are booked on an accrual
basis . i have had several meetings with commercial and accounting
representatives over the last year and all have stated that any earnings are
effectively reinvested back into the assets . therefore , the market values
that are reflected on the mpr are actually book values . the book values are
typically adjusted the last week of the month and are 1 month behind as the
internation groups wait until the gl is closed before communicating the
updated values .
question 2 ) thanks for the heads - up on india . i spoke with sheila glover
and we are now aware of the details behind rediff . com . we need to ensure
that these positions are not accounted for on the dpr by india so that we do
not double - report the p & l . the long - term solution is to establish a
communication line for future investments . between sheila , donna lowry , and
i we can develop a plan .
question 3 ) the 3 bonds that you are referencing were purchased by jeff
kinneman for jim easter . during our last conversation , jim told jeff that
these are strategic investments and should not be reflected on the mpr .
there is still some uncertainty / confusion as to when an investment is
classified as merchant . we could insist that all publically traded
investments not included in the equity books would qualify . having said
that , i would like to know if the gas authority of india , ltd ( gail ) and
europe ' s investment in mg are considered to be merchant investments .
i will be on vacation this friday and all of next week so please include
david maxwell on any responses . david and i will stay in touch so as to make
adjustments as needed .

mr . hall ,
i have just reviewed the merchant portfolio summary for 6 / 20 and have the
following questions :
1 ) calme shows an asset of $ 291 . 9 mm and apachi shows an asset of $ 113 . 0 mm
and they show no p & l for the year
is this possible in a world of changing interest rates and equity premiums
and commodity prices ?
2 ) india recently invested in an ipo ( rediff . com ) for which there was a
simultaneous dash to buy and sell ( sounds like a merchant deal ) .
where does this show up ?
3 ) there are several bonds ( publicly traded , registrered securities , housed
in our prime broker accounts ) owned by various enron entities
that i do not believe are on the dpr . shouldn ' t they be ? and if so , who is
deciding not to include ?
pls advise at your earliest convenience as you always do .

the two licenses are :
1 . enterprise software license agreement between legato
systems , inc . and [ e ] corp , dated as of sept . 27 , 2001 , respecting
numerous software products generally branded with the names
networker , gems , celestra , octopus and others . section 2 . 2
provides : "" restrictions on use . licensee shall not , and shall
not aid , abet or permit any third party to : . . . ( iii ) . . . use
for timesharing or service bureau purposes or otherwise use . . .
the software . . . for the benefit of third parties . . . . ""
2 . products license agreement # 3185 modified for [ e ]
corp , issued by ration software corp . , dated as of feb . 17 , 1998 ,
respecting various software products branded clearcase , rational ,
purify , and quantify and others . section 1 . 1 provides : "" general
grant of license . . . . you may not rent , lease or use the product
in a service bureau capacity . . . . . ""
we continue to review the agreements for the service
bureau issue as it is the most pressing from a time perspective .
we have already found several ambiguous licenses and will bring
those to your attention as a group later .
if other express provisions such as the above turn up , i
will let you know on a case by case basis as this issue is one our
it personnel are taking seriously .

that they are keeping hawkins in london and nobody bothered to reply to my message - so i rang sherriff and told him what had happened - he is now spooked because he doesn ' t even check his tax return - he just signs them .
i partly annoyed because they didn ' t respond to my message nor tell sherriff anything of the problems .

if this has not been done - i would like to know who is requesting phillip is retained . i spoke to john who was not aware of the issues - he does feel that this tax year is out of the question . but going forward this should be an issue - john was also unaware of the advice i had been given which is clearly incorrect .
why did i receive no response to this email should the action i requested not have been implemented .

i have recently had some very bad experiences with philip ' s advice and suggest that he is removed from enron ' s account completely . obviously david has had him removed from working on anything this side of the atlantic .
i feel strongly that enron employees should not be exposed to the potential liabilities which could be incurred through incorrect advice and would suggest your side of the water remove him also in the interests of enron as a whole .
if you want to know the details let me know . let me know if you have problems removing him and i will further explain why i think our individuals are at risk .

pursuant to our telephone conversations , this e - mail is to confirm enron ' s desire to begin the process of purchasing the outstanding securities associated with ena clo i trust . i have confirmed that the april 30 , 2001 liability due under the remaining active isda is $ 3 . 71 million . as your firm conducts discussions with investors , our counsel has recommended language to be used as follows :
"" as has been disclosed in recent monthly reports , the underlying assets of
ena clo i have continued to perform under expectations . given current
economic conditions , it is possible that the assets will continue to
underperform for the foreseeable future . in addition , while enron
continues to seek to maximize the recovery on all of
the portfolio assets , it is difficult to predict the
ultimate recovery that can be expected on the portfolio assets , or the
ultimate recovery that noteholders can expect .
as you know , enron has responded to noteholder concerns by providing
substantial additional structural support to ena clo i . in lieu of providing
further support , enron is offering to purchase all of the
outstanding notes on april 30 , 2001 for the principal balance plus accrued
interest .
enron believes that this proposal is the most expeditious and effective
means of addressing the concerns of the noteholders . noteholders are
encouraged to contact bear , stearns with any comments or questions that they
may have regarding this proposal . ""

title : brazil ' s rationing plan : a step away from market mechanisms ?
url : http : / / www 20 . cera . com / eprofile ? u = 35 & m = 2381
rationing plan continues to evolve as threat looms
brazil ? s hydro reservoirs ? current stored energy is well below the levels
necessary to assure supply throughout the dry season . despite a general
acceptance that rationing is becoming inevitable , the brazilian government has
not announced how it will be implemented . key issues include the following :
* it is too late to sufficiently increase supply to avoid a crisis .
* the power shortage could reduce gdp growth by 0 . 5 to 1 . 5 percent .
* immediate implementation of rationing will minimize the depth of the required
cuts .
* * end * *

subject : visit to enron
hello vince ,
it was nice seeing you at stanford and many thanks for the lunch
we had together . i really enjoyed our discussions , both at the
technical level and otherwise .
i promised to send you an e - mail regarding possible dates for
a visit to enron . i delayed it for a week till my schedule was
clearer . let ' s see if we can get a match with your schedule -
mine is rather terrible :
friday , 21 st of april looks good . but april 23 rd is easter
sunday , so that may make it difficult for some people at enron
to be around . let me know if that is the case . i am willing to
visit then , because the week after that i am scheduled to be in
japan and in the previous weeks i am all committed on fridays .
friday , 19 th of may is the next possibility , but this probably
is too far out . the main problem is that i am operating within
a window of opportunity for attracting top students for this
research . this window closes by the end of april , and it would be
important for the student support funds to be in place then , so
that i can make hard commitments to students and attract top
talent . i am already reviewing files of students who have
approached me for phd advising , and i am in a mode of doing "" soft
commitments to star - level students "" to get this research and its
potential on their radar screen . top students are highly sought
after by advisors and i want to be an early player in this
competition .
does my visit to enron have to happen before we can set up the
project and student support at stanford ? if so , doing it before the
end of april is important for getting top people . if the visit can
happen after we get the ball rolling , then we can schedule it in may .
i assume there will be multiple visits both ways when the project gets
going . please let me know what you think .

7 % private market value discount remains
>
good morning ,
attached , please find the latest issue of our independent power weekly .
summary :
1 . ipps rise 5 . 0 % last week our ipp composite rose 5 . 0 % , outperforming the
s & p 500 ( + 1 . 6 % ) and the nasdaq ( + 3 . 8 % ) . aes corp ( aes ) , which was up 22 . 2 % ,
was the strongest generator in the group followed by reliant resources ( rri )
which rose 11 . 0 % . orion power ( orn ) was the weakest performer , rising 1 . 2 % .
2 . generation oriented utilities fall 2 . 8 % our universe of
generation - oriented utilities fell 2 . 8 % , in - line with the uty ( - 2 . 5 % ) .
black hills ( bkh ) , cleco ( cnl ) and constellation energy ( ceg ) all rose less
than 1 % . allegheny energy was the weakest performer , down 7 . 6 % .
3 . ene / dyn + attractive valuations boost stock prices last week was the
3 rd consecutive week of positive stock price performance for the group .
driving stock prices higher , investors continued to grow more comfortable
with the enron situation following confirmation of dynegy ' s intention to
acquire enron and provide immediate liquidity support by investing $ 1 . 5
billion . further , we believe the group simply remains oversold . the pure
play power producers are trading at a 7 % average discount to their private
market asset values .
4 . notes from mirant meeting mirant hosted an upbeat analyst meeting last
tuesday . mir reiterated that 80 % of its 2002 forecast is supported by
earnings from hedged ( generation and natural gas ) and franchise businesses
( distribution ) . mir also provided an in - depth review of how it accounts for
its risk management activities . management noted that it could maintain its
credit rating without any new equity issuance over the next 12 months .
however , it would be eager to access the equity market should conditions
improve in the near - term .
5 . power market update last week the us power markets were generally weak
across the country owing to mild weather and falling natural gas prices .
while the mirant national power index fell 17 . 1 % last week , the natural gas
week composite spot price fell 23 . 2 % . spark spreads improved in the
northeast and texas , while compressing in california and the southeast .
6 . debt market update credit spreads tightened across the sector last week
due to diminished ene concerns and positive stock price performance .

"i ' ve been spending a fair bit of time sitting with the troops , sharing information with them , getting a sense of the mood and basically just trying to be visible , accessible and supportive . i think for the most part , people are trying to give us time for things to settle out , while trying also to ensure they have an escape route in case things go pear - shaped .
kal and heather were both out last friday and will be out until wednesday , so we have not done anything yet to modify the designs . i did send them both an email on the subject , though , so we should be on the case on wednesday .
christmas was great - thanks for asking . we had a quiet christmas with just the two of us . i repainted the helicopter ( have pictures , if you ' re interested ) .
have you been having a good visit with your mom and dad ? hopefully you ' ve been able to put this place out of your mind when you go home . . .

jennifer doesn ' t know it yet , but when i submitted final numbers to hr , i kept her suggested increases and did not apply her suggested decreases ( which she did to balance the increases ) .
i expect we are going to lose some people . i hope the ones that go are not the best ones . obviously , the more we are willing to spend in bonus , the fewer the people we will lose .
when would you like to get together to discuss ?

louise ,
i am sorry to bother you at such a critical time , because i know you are doing everything you can to salvage the remaining pieces at enron and are working long & tiresome hours to achieve this difficult matter .
however , i felt like i had to at least let you know my thoughts on the following .
dave forster & i met a couple of weeks ago on his initiative to discuss the proposed retention bonuses for my group . i was asked to review the preliminary numbers by individual . i was allowed to move dollars but not allowed to increase the total dollar figure for my group . frankly , the numbers seemed pretty low .
assuming the goal is to retain key employees for netco , i am not confident these numbers will achieve this .
i know several people in my group are interviewing outside of the company . i have asked them to be patient , not make any quick decisions , and give us a chance to see this through .
dave told me the figures were based on mid year evaluations . as you know , mid year evaluations are typically lower than year end . the mid year evaluation allows the employee time to improve in order to get to the desired level by year end . i understand the need for a reference point of some sort and mid year was the latest figure available . however , because the retention numbers were based on this , they are significantly lower .
my intentions are not to show any disrepect to dave by discussing this with you but i wanted to make sure my thoughts / opinions were communicated to you . if dave has already discussed this with you , i apologize for the duplication .
if you have any questions , please feel free to call me . i am on holiday & will be traveling today but can be reached on my cell at 713 - 446 - 9669 .
thank you for your time .

"tracy ,
attached is a spreadsheet model which contains both black - scholes and
american option valuation models . these are the generally accepted methods
for valuation of options on equity . the "" european "" option prices assume
that the option holder can exercise his options only at maturity , while the
"" american "" style options can be exercised at any time during their life .
i have assumed in the examples that the underlying equity units have a market
value of $ 13 . 00 and that the options are struck at this level . the
volatility input is the other main assumption . eott has been trading
recently with a volatility ranging between 30 % to 40 % although looking
further back , the range is much wider .
to run the model , you must be linked with the options library . i am not
sure what lan you are connected with , but you can coordinate with zimin lu
( x 36388 ) for help with loading the option library add - in module . on the ena
lan it is located under o : \ research \ exotica \ xll \ exotica . xll . this is
loaded in excel using the tools / add - ins and browse to reach the add - in
location .

as well . if you would like us to help you in running specific examples ,
please let me , vince , or zimin know .",NO_IGNORE

can research in houston put together a comparison of the long - term volatility
curves for gas and power in north america and europe ? based on where europe
is marked ( especially for the uk ) , i think we ' ll find a significant
difference out beyond 10 years . fundamentally , it seems like the long - term
vol should be similar for a given commodity regardless of geographic location .
has research done any work on this in the past ? if not , we should study this
since long - term vol feeds into the var - based position limits .
give me a call so we can discuss .

the following provides background information for your call with mel klein at gkh ( ref : the gkh memo you sent to me ) . over the past year , a number of groups / individuals have assessed the merits of acquiring gkh ' s interest in hanover and all have declined due to strategic as well as financial considerations .

cc :
subject : hanover gkh merger idea
the following is a quick review of the gkh merger analysis and the reasons we do not support it . it is also important to keep in mind that gkh is motivated to create a short - term exit from hanover due to the exigencies of their investment partnership expiration . klein ' s agenda is transparent .
1 . while hanover is a well - managed , growth company , it is not a "" turnaround "" or "" special opportunity "" situation for which application of enron ' s business model would promise the extraordinary returns required in order to justify an investment of $ 3 billion .
2 . as enron ' s stock price has declined , the attractiveness of using it as a currency in any acquisition has decreased . the pe decline also tends to make stock deals more dilutive to enron .
3 . the gkh analysis asserts $ 128 million in initial year synergies and cost savings . however , these benefits are largely predicated upon ( a ) use of the enron nol ( which is an asset enron already owns and can be applied to earnings from any acquisition ) - - $ 55 million and ( b ) speculative economies of scale , i . e . higher revenues and margins and significant sg & a reductions - - $ 38 million .
the remaining $ 36 million of cited benefits relates to a proposed decapitalization of hanover from a proposed transfer of assets to a non - recourse trust ( although credit enhancement and operational guarantees would be required ) . achieving these benefits would require obtaining the best possible outcome on a number of accounting , financial and credit issues . however , even if all of these issues were resolved , the economic result is insufficient to justify the transaction . the gkh analysis does not consider transaction , transition or capital costs .
4 . after taking into account the capital expenditures required for hanover to achieve its aggressive growth targets , the company appears to be at best cash flow neutral or slightly cash flow negative for the three years presented in the gkh analysis ( even including all claimed synergies and cost savings ) .
5 . enron and hanover could achieve and share many of the synergistic benefits claimed for the merger in a properly structured joint venture . ( however , this would still require finding an internal enron "" sponsor "" to assume ownership of the relationship ) .
6 . much of hanover ' s growth in the future is predicated upon an aggressive expansion and expenditure program internationally . given enron ' s domestic opportunities , this international orientation in a non - core business is inconsistent with our present strategy .
7 . like gkh , enron has been a seller of our hanover position . an abrupt reversal of strategies could create significant uncertainties and confusion on the street about enron ' s strategic direction .
additional background to demonstrate the magnitude of the limitations of the gkh analysis with respect to increasing enron ' s eps :
1 . if pooling of interest accounting is available , any acquisition enron makes of any company that has a lower pe ratio than enron is accretive to enron ' s eps . there is nothing "" remarkable "" about this , it is simple mathematics .
2 . if purchase accounting is required , even if the entire purchase price were accounted as "" goodwill "" and never amortized , this would only replicate the results of pooling of interest . however , in actuality , a significant proportion of the purchase price would have to be allocated to assets ( tangible and intangible such as contracts ) which would produce additional depreciation and amortization expense not mentioned in the gkh analysis .
3 . the largest single "" synergy "" by far in the gkh analysis is usage of enron ' s nol to shield hanover ' s taxable earnings . enron can obtain the benefit of its nol by acquiring any profitable company . gm recorded about $ 3 . 4 billion in income tax expense last year which would offer even greater opportunity to utilitize this enron asset .
4 . the gkh analysis is totally silent with respect to the biggest single immediate risk of a transaction , i . e . the potential negative impact on enron ' s own pe .

"hi daren ,
i enjoyed our lunch together yesterday and believe we made a good beginning .
you have very high standards for your own performance and are highly
committed to the best outcome in all situations . you are likely to have high
expectations for results from our coaching meetings this a good formula for
success and i will do my best to honor your strengths with a focus on moving
the action forward . with this in mind , i had some thoughts and additional
questions for reflection following the meeting that i would like to share .
you are in a transition from being a high team performer to becoming the
leader of a high performing team . one of your frustrations as leader is
that members of your team seem to rely too much on you to solve problems
that arise in the day to day operations of the team . at first you responded
to their requests for help by solving it for them , then you shifted to using
questioning techniques to have them solve the problem with you . you have
also offered some training to address the learnings needed to be more
independent problem solvers . you are frustrated when some members of the
team continue to come to you with questions they should be able to solve and
when they fail to implement changes that you have trained them to use . you
are seeking ways for the the team to have the same problem solving ability
that they come to you for . you have recruited people with this ability and
you seek to expand it in the team .
this issue was the focus of our first session and needs to be the focus our
next meeting . the question is : how to engage the team in solving this
problem . how do i get the members of this team to own this responsibility
and begin creating their own solutions ? what resources are needed by each
person to contribute more to this problem ? how do i involve the team members
more in the solving of this problem ? what new behaviors do i need to employ
to increase the involvement of the team ? what do i need to change in myself
or my relationship to the people in order to engage them more actively in
the problem ?
there is one dimension that i am clear about . i know that you have used
performance appraisals to give feedback . have you put this issue before the
team as a whole for the team to solve or have you tried to change individual
team members ?
i look forward to our meeting on the 17 th . keep growing !

currently , the tw market team manually calculates the various prices associated with our negotiated rate deals at the end of every month . once the calculation is complete , the price is input into the billing system so customer invoices can be generated . i have 3 - 4 people spending a full day every month end performing this rate calc for their deals ( no two are exactly alike ) .
these calculations are all based on various published market indices . as you evaluate the development and installation of the new contract billing system , is there a way we can automate this rate process ? were it not for the manual labor process , the tw team would likely do more index - based negotitations .

subject : help on dpc lng options
vince ,
this is a follow - up of our meeting with jeff shankman on friday , as well as
our discussions with the global assets group on dpc issues .
as you see , there is a need for developing a comprehensive fuel strategy for
dpc that encompasses both the lng phase , and the naphtha side . furthermore ,
any fuel strategy we develop will have to be in consonance with the power
side of the business . there is a lot of analytical work that will be
required in this context over the next several months , and we will need a
person who understands both the power and the fuel side of the business at
dpc .
i believe anshuman is just such a person . he has worked closely with me over
the last 2 yrs . , and has been trained in the derivatives side of the business
( he has attended all three levels of derivatives classes offered at enron ) .
over the last month , his presence in houston has greatly helped me in melding
the henwood study with the picture on the lng / fuel side . i believe his
presence in houston will be critical to us developing a comprehensive
fuel / lng strategy for dabhol , together with the global markets and asset
groups .
i am therefore requesting you to explore the possibility of anshuman being
moved on a more permanent basis to houston . as you are aware , anshuman
himself would welcome such an arrangement .

a measurement framework for bank liquidity risk

vice president , finrad inc .
raymond cote is vice president , financial engineering at finrad inc . , a
montreal - based consulting firm offering financial management solutions that
combine advisory and systems development services to & corporations and
financial institutions .
abstract :
liquidity risk , as opposed to credit and market risks , has received little
attention in professional or academic journals . we argue that analyzing bank
liquidity risk can be viewed as a variation of credit risk analysis . after
introducing some concepts and definitions , the presentation defines a
framework allowing to measure a bank ' s structural liquidity risk . it then
shows that combining the framework with modern credit risk measurement tools
leads to a liquidity risk var measure . the presentation then offers
concluding comments on the integration of the liquidity risk measurement
framework within enterprise - wide risk management .

i spoke w / fernley dyson , cao for ee and barry ' s current boss , and he ' s
supportive of barry ' s transfer to our region to lead the
accounting / commercial support efforts for your tokyo office . i also spoke
with barry , and he ' s excited as well . i think it ' s a done deal .
scott / michael - i told barry one of you would contact him tomorrow to discuss
the next steps re : a more standard expat package ( not the 6 month situation -
causey approved a more standard longer term expat arrangement ) , and plans to
move his family to tokyo .
the issue we need to work out is transition , and i asked barry to discuss
that with you directly , joe , and i told fernley we ' d obviously be flexible
but we ' d like him sooner rather than later . barry indicated the guy that
fernley just hired that barry was going to be reporting to is going to start
towards the end of april . so i bet they ' re going to want some overlap there ,
which puts us into end of may before barry could really move . i think we
should be able to accomodate this somewhat longer transition period with
heidi ' s help and with carol from houston if necessary , plus i told barry we ' d
want him to make at least a couple of trips over to tokyo in the interim so
he can start getting involved even before he moves over there . but it will
be important for us to understand what specifically you want accounting to
accomplish by the end of may so heidi and carol can plan how to support those
efforts while not infringing on heidi ' s responsibilities and demands in
sydney .
meanwhile , i ' ve asked hr to contact eugenio perez , sally ' s designee for the
temporary risk position , to begin those discussions , and sally said she could
address transition issues for him next week - she ' ll be in london
( scott / michael - you should probably give her a call in the london office
their monday afternoon ) . perhaps we can get eugenio over to tokyo earlier

bottom line : it ' s tentatively scheduled for the morning of 17 october here in houston . if you and dave are available , i ' ll coordinate . you won ' t need to sign , just provide some presence . there ' s still some flexibility if that day doesn ' t work for you .
thanks ,

subject : cash & reorg financial reporting
re : chapter 11 reorganization
financial reporting requirements
many people have questions regarding how enron will be operating under chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings . this memo addresses the financial reporting requirements enron will have to its various constituents .
during the reorganization , the company will continue its gaap reporting , with a breakout of pre and post petition liabilities , as well as historical management / operational reporting , consistent with past practices .
in addition , the company will have an added responsibility to report cash flows to the bankruptcy court and its various constituents . specifically , enron will be required to report projected cash receipts and cash disbursements by business unit on a weekly basis . the court and our new debtor - in - possession ( "" dip "" ) lenders require a rolling 13 week projection of cash flows plus monthly projections thereafter to obtain a full year of projected cash flows . the budgeted weekly projections will then be compared to actual results to determine how well each business unit is operating compared to the projections . the weekly and monthly forecasts will be adjusted each week pursuant to revised or improved information on forecasted cash flows . thus this process will be an ongoing one , with constant updating of information to ensure we generate the most accurate reports possible .
the initial weekly and monthly projections will be critical to the determination of the amount that the dip lenders will be willing to make available to the company . in addition , the cash flows for the entities that are included in the bankruptcy proceedings will be utilized by the bankruptcy court and dip lenders to constantly review and react to the cash flow situation at enron . however , all enron business units ( not just ones in bankruptcy ) will need to conform to these new requirements , because additional entities are likely to be included in the bankruptcy filing and because it is extremely important for enron management to be able to see the totality of cash flow requirements for the entire company .
the weekly cash flow projection project will be overseen by mike deville ( x 57852 ) and greg adams ( x 33887 ) . in addition , enron has retained batchelder & partners , inc . , a financial advisory firm , to assist us in this and other reorganization efforts .
we will be having a group meeting with the cao ' s and / or their designees from the various business units responsible for the cash projections on wednesday , december 5 at 2 : 00 pm in the boardroom on the 50 th floor to further explain this process and answer any questions you may have . we will then be meeting on an individual basis with the business units to discuss specific business unit requirements .
attached is a template of the financial statement projection format that will be required . please review this template in advance of the wednesday meeting to determine any questions you have on the reporting format . obviously the requirements may change , which will require us to reformat and / or obtain additional information on short notification .
thank you in advance for your cooperation . we look forward to your attendance on wednesday .",NO_IGNORE

dear enron friends
some of you may know that i have been recently diagnosed with non - small cell
lung cancer . this wednesday may 23 i will have this cancerous tumor removed .
hopefully that will be it and all will return to normal shortly and you will see
me again soon . it is my understanding that i will be in the hospital for about
1 week and they say i will be down for another six ( 6 ) weeks after that .
apparently they have not dealt with anyone that has the same tenacity and
inability to sit still as me . at any rate i ' ll be out for a while .
during my absense my assistant , karla hesketh , will continue to do the same
wonderful job that she has done for all of us throughout the years . i have a
very good friend , john vollen who is a rep for abb out in the great northwest
that has graciously volunteered to come to houston for 2 - 3 days a week for as
long as necessary to help us with the enron business . randy hayes will also
help john and will provide introductions when necessary and appropriate . please
welcome john as you have me in the past . you will find that he is eager to help
and very capable . he has been in sales for ten years and is a graduate
engineer . just don ' t get to used to him as i will return .
after i get home i ' ll call to check on all of you and make sure that all is well
with business and you personally . i am very grateful to have the enron account
and i have grown close to many of you and enjoy working on the interesting , and
yes , sometimes challenging projects that we are faced with .
again , please continue to work with john and karla as you have worked with me in
the past . i ' ll keep you updated as to my progress .

"application of the fuel retained from transportation and treating contracts
doesn ' t have to be done by zone or compressor , in fact i am sure there will
be times when we are either short or long compressor fuel when compared to
the pipelines total usage . usually , short . i just do not think the market
will let me lay off all of this risk . it would be really nice if we could
get the system to track compressor fuel used to service specific contracts
but i am afraid it will always be a facility planning issue . fuel should not
cause imbalances on the transportation contract . a pipeline could be long
fuel due to not running compression and in that case we would have to inject
or hold in linepack the excess . it seems that we would look at fuel on a

that pipeline operations can handle the scheduling of third party fuel
retainage . but , if we retain fuel on ena transports , then we need to come up
with a plan to nominate this in marketing operations to houston pipeline .

i have recently come on board as treasurer , enron india . prior to joining ,
i was with reliance industries , a petrochemical conglomerate in india .
the central banking authorities are now thinking of permitting
corporates to hedge their oil and other related risks . i believe the
literature published
by risk in collaboration with enron has come to be considered as an
industry standard . would it be possible to arrange for two copies to be sent
across to us .

hope you had an enjoyable thanksgiving !
i found out the "" scoop "" on the ticket . it was non - refundable and non -
refundable tickets cannot be transferred . it was just your seat that
maureen ' s husband used .
i will send in a check request for reimbursement in the amount of $ 330 . 50 .
the best thing would be for you to go ahead and pay the bill or wait for
the check from us .
sorry for the confusion !

shirley ,
how are you ? things are fine over here . we are still trying to settle in ;
this process seems to be taking forever .
i would like to ask for your help . i have received a statement from
american express related to my enron account . the charge amount is $ 330 . 50 ,
which is supposed to be for an airplane ticket . after calling the travel
agency in the park , i found out that this was the ticket that i was
supposed to have used to fly to colorado . however , the ticket was used by
maurine ' s husband and maurine claimed to have paid for the ticket . also , i
remember calling the tap and cancelling prior to the travel date . can you
help me figure out what is going on here ? i am not sure who is supposed to
pay for this . i disputed the charge before but my dispute was rejected .
i appreciate your help . thanks .

"hi jaideep !
my first suggestion is that you come to houston as scheduled ( and arranged
with wharton nearly 3 weeks ago ) . alternatively , rely on your tiger
teammates to gather information necessary to respond to the project . should
circumstances lead you to decide not to come for this trip , please return the
ticket issued to you . should it make sense for you to visit enron some time
in the future , we can discuss arrangements at that time .
hope to see you soon !

hello christie ,
thank you for organizing the wharton trip to enron . unfortunately , the
flight setup for tomorrow is way too early for me as i ' ll have to miss over
4 hours of classes , which i cannot afford to do . i tried changing the time
with continental and there latest flight leaves at 6 pm - which does not work
for me ( smack in the middle of my 3 hour class )
thus the dilemma that i find myself in is the following :
a . try a different flight as i can make any flight after 7 : 30 pm ( however , i
have no control over reservations / budget etc )
b . as it is possible to delay travel upto 1 year , use this ticket to come
some other time
sorry for this but i just saw the bookings today .
any suggestions ?
thanks ,

"hi green roomers ,
the fall outdoor soccer season is just around the corner and the schedules
have been posted to the gpsd website at
http : / / www . gpsdsoccer . com /
you will be surprised to learn , like i was , that we were not promoted to the lst division . it seems that the league has decided to keep us in 2 nd even
though i registered for and said we would accept the promotion to lst
division in order to be eligible for the championship .
our first game is on sunday sept . 9 th at delta park # 8 ( ne of strasser ) at
12 : 15 . all of the rest of the games in the 10 game season will also be at
12 : 15 and will occur every sunday between sept 9 th and november 18 th with
the exception of sunday october 21 st when we have a bye . we then will have
a championship game in early december since we will win the league again .
right ?
don ' t forget to update your player care if you had a recent birthday or are
new to the team . you update or get a player card at the oasa league office
off of highway 26 at the sylvan exit . they do have odd hours so call them
before you head up there .
anyway that is enough from me . see you soon out on the soccer pitch .

"here is a brief summary of my meeting with chris germany , capacity trader at
the east desk , related to gas transmission :
typically , pipelines lease capacity billed on a monthly basis . an example
might be the pipeline between south texas and brooklyn , where you might pay
$ 12 . 00 per month per 10 , 000 decatherms of capacity ( $ 0 . 40 per day ) , a fixed
payment . variable charges are 6 % for fuel costs ( "" shrinkage "" ) and 6 . 5 % for
overhead expenses . a gas trader might call south texas and be quoted a
delivery price tomorrow of nymex - $ 0 . 10 ( "" basis "" ) , and might call brooklyn
and be quoted a delivered price of nymex + $ 0 . 25 . the trader ' s spread is
$ 0 . 35 , and variable costs of transmission are $ 0 . 125 , so the trader would
offer the leaseholder of capacity up to $ 0 . 225 for firm capacity tomorrow .
as for the distinction betweem firm and interruptible , the leaseholders have
an excellent knowledge of the firm - equivalent of interruptible capacity .
also , many pipelines don ' t discount firm capacity from the tariff maximum
( "" it ' s not worth their time to haggle "" ) ( there is a further issue of
"" secondary markets "" not important to the model yet ) . for south texas and
brooklyn , there are several different routes the gas can physically take
( pipelines of enron , texas eastern , etc ) . and , once the trade is in the
system traders can cover the ( enron ) positions on each end of the pipeline ,
in so doing freeing up the capacity for other contracts .

"? a source within the generator community confirms press reporting that coram energy plans to file an involuntary bankruptcy early next week . through an intermediary , we were able to corroborate this information with a senior member of the ca iso board . coram energy is a relatively small wind generator qf based in west vancouver , british columbia , though it also owns wind stations in california . coram has 238 40 kw units .
? the source believes that this filing may have been precipitated by the fact that many people believe it would take a blackout for governor davis to be able to get his bailout plan passed by the legislature . it is unlikely that blackouts would happen in april or may , meaning a long wait for the cash strapped qfs to wait to get paid .
? the filing will be against socal .

subject : re - alignment
thanks to all of you , enron north america has had an outstanding year in
2000 . some of the more notable accomplishments include :
a ) 100 % plus increase in ebit from 1999 actuals to 2000 forecast ;
b ) significant rationalization of the balance sheet including the sale of the
( i ) wind river / powder river gathering assets , ( ii ) east coast power
generating assets , ( iii ) hpl and ( iv ) five of the six eastern peakers ;
c ) ena is the leading energy merchant by a factor of two ;
d ) physical electricity volume grew by 34 % ytd 1999 to ytd 2000 forecast ;
e ) natural gas volumes grew by 82 % ytd 1999 to ytd 2000 forecast ;
f ) 500 % growth in daily transactions from november 1999 to november 2000 due
to the highly successful enron online distribution channel ; and
g ) ena reaching its 25 % roce target .
these are truly outstanding accomplishments and our expectations for growth
and opportunity in enron north america for 2001 are consistent with that
success . in order to reach these goals , we felt it necessary to re - align a
number of our organizations . a number of these changes are completed . the
goals of such re - alignment include :
a ) increase overall productivity with the goal to ensure that every employee
is in a position to contribute regardless of skill set ;
b ) increase overall market coverage , deal flow and information generation
with the goal to increase bid / offer income , increase the velocity of deal
flow , improve customer coverage and promote quality information transfer to
our trading organization ;
c ) increase deal quality and earnings quality with the goal to ( i ) allocate
our resources towards the best transactions and ( ii ) significantly increase
our 
d ) promote real time decision making and a closer tie between our trading and
origination ( mid - market and structured ) organizations in order to better
align those functions to reduce the amount of un - productive internal focus ;
e ) increase the overall velocity of the capital being utilized consistent
with our goal of a 25 % plus return on capital employed ; and
f ) identify and recognize a host of new leaders in the organization that are
critical to meeting our goals next year .
with these objectives in mind , patterned after the successful business models
in calgary and portland , effective immediately the following changes are
being implemented :
a ) east power  ) a single east power team incorporating trading , mid - market
and origination will be formed under the co - leadership of kevin presto and
janet dietrich who will report to the enron americas - office of the chairman
( ea ooc ) . this team will have one income statement , one book and a joint
accountability . however , a clear delineation of responsibilities inside these
teams will continue to exist in which the trading organization will manage
the risk , income statement and product development aspects of the
partnership . the originators will have the primary responsibility to generate
origination income , provide coverage , deal flow , lead strategy formulation ,
provide information and generate strategic positions . overall , the team will
be rewarded based upon increasing the value of the book , meeting
coverage / deal flow targets and meeting its strategic / growth goals in the
eastern power markets . the team will be responsible for covering the iou  , s ,
muni  , s / co - ops , industrials and ipp  , s and will utilize all ena  , s product
capabilities including the power commodity , assets and capital . the team will
further be broken down into several key strategic regions and business units
including :
( i ) ercot  ) managed by doug gilbert smith and bruce sukaly ;
( ii ) ne  ) managed by dana davis and jeff ader ;
( iii ) midwest  ) managed by fletch sturm and ed baughman ;
( iv ) se  ) managed by rogers herndon and ozzie pagan ;
( v ) east power development  ) managed by ben jacoby ;
( vi ) east power structuring - managed by bernie aucoin ; and
( vii ) east power fundamentals and the 
east gas  ) a single east gas team incorporating trading , mid - market and
origination will be formed under the co - leadership of scott neal and frank
vickers who will be returning from portland to join this team .
west gas  ) in a similar manner , a west gas team will be formed co - managed by
phillip allen and barry tycholiz , who will be joining us in houston from the
canadian team . the denver office under mark whitt will be integrated under
this team .
central gas  ) in a similar manner , a central gas team will be formed
co - managed by hunter shively and laura luce . the chicago office will be
integrated into this team .
texas gas  ) the texas gas team will be managed by tom martin . this team will
continue to manage the gas trading business around hpl until the pending sale
is concluded in q 2 2001 . after the sale of hpl , this team will build a texas
gas business without ownership of the hpl assets .
financial  ) this group will continue to be managed by john arnold with no
significant changes .
derivatives  ) this group , lead by fred lagrasta , will offer derivative and
financial mid - market products and services to the natural gas market
specifically targeting cfo  , s and treasury departments . fred will continue to
maintain certain existing mid - market accounts with a number of producer and
industrial accounts where relationships are well formed . otherwise ,
mid - market coverage will gravitate to the regions . the new york office gas
marketing efforts will continue to be managed by fred .
upstream products  ) this group , lead by jean mrha , will develop several
distinct product offerings for the upstream segment of the gas market . this
group will develop and market the product in conjunction with the regions .
this is consistent with our desire to have a broader product offering and
greater market penetration in the upstream segment . these products include
producer outsourcing , similar to our successful petro - canada and suncor
relationships in canada , physical storage re - engineering , compressor
services , wellhead liquidity products and offshore asset and capital
products . in addition , jean will manage our bridgeline joint venture with
texaco .
gas structuring  ) this group will be lead by ed mcmichael , reporting to frank
vickers , will provide structuring and deal support to all the gas teams .
gas fundamentals  ) this group will be lead by chris gaskill , reporting to
hunter shively , will provide fundamentals to all the gas teams .
julie gomez will continue to support the gas floor through several identified
projects including long - term supply / demand analysis and , natural gas
transportation capacity trading opportunities .
there is an expectation of some customer overlap between the gas and power
groups ; for example , the combination utilities and the ipp  , s . the teams will
coordinate with regard to the combination utilities like con . edison or
pg & e . with regard to the ipp  , s , to the extent that the product offering
involves an underlying power position , the power teams will manage . we have
asked janet dietrich to coordinate such overlaps between the two
organizations in houston .
e ) technical / restructuring - in the effort to consolidate and centralize our
technical resources ( engineering , development , operations , pipeline ) to
ensure that this skill base is available to all ena groups and utilized
productively across the organization , brian redmond will form and manage the
technical services group . this group will manage ena  , s technical risks and
will provide , on a cost basis , technical services for the entire ena
organization . this group will manage the interface with ee therefore , eliminating the need to change legal entities et al .
if you are currently a commercial employee of ena or esa you will continue to
conduct business in that company .
we look forward to another exciting year in the north american energy
market . this is certainly a company unrivaled in the marketplace with the
most talented employees . the opportunities are endless . we wish you and
your family a very happy and safe holiday season .",NO_IGNORE

executive summary :
utility bankruptcy appears increasingly likely next week unless the state can clear three hurdles - agreement on payback for the bailout , rate increases , and further short - term funding for dwr purchases of power .
disagreement persists between gov . davis and democrats in the legislature on how the state should be paid back for its bailout of the utilities . the split is over a stock warrant plan versus state ownership of utility transmission assets .
the economics of the long - term contracts appear to show that rate hikes are unavoidable because of the need to amortize the undercollected rates of the utilities during the recent rate freeze period .
air quality management district regulations are under review , but offer limited scope for providing additional generation capacity .
legislature democrats are feeling intense pressure from the left - wing consumer groups and are being forced to at least slow , if not stop , davis ' s bailout and rate hike plans . senator burton ' s eminent domain threats against generators , which reflect this pressure , are of little significance .
1 . bankruptcy outlook rising once again
a deal to finalize a debt workout continues to be just beyond the reach of the state , the utilities , and their creditors , with time running out on the debt forbearance arrangement set to expire on tuesday .
socal edison and pg & e are not paying any of their bills except for payroll . they are working very hard to keep cash on - hand , and have indicated that they feel that they are very close to an involuntary bankruptcy filing . once this filing occurs , they will have 50 days until either the bankruptcy court accepts the filing or the utilities file a voluntary bankruptcy .
opinion within the assembly is divided with respect to the outlook for bankruptcy . assemblyman keeley told our source that a filing is likely , but that everything will be resolved during that 50 - day period . senator john burton "" is in no hurry "" to reach a deal with the utilities , as he believes that the state of california is in a good position to "" strong - arm "" the utilities . burton currently does not intend to cede to the utilities so that they can avoid bankruptcy . the senator stated , "" bankruptcy would be bad , but not the worst thing possible . "" he intends to stick to his position . senator burton also dismissed governor davis ' end - of - week deadline for striking a deal with the utilities .
still , bankruptcy can be avoided if a last - minute deal can be struck monday on :
what the state receives in return for the bailout
the scope of rate hikes ( a federal court is expected to rule on the pg & e / socal v . cpuc rate undercollection case monday )
additional financing is made available to the dwr to buy more power until the revenue bonds can be issued in may .
there is a possibility that significant progress on these issues could lead to a further extension of creditor forbearance . however , the negative tone taken by standard & poors and others concerning delays in the legislature suggest that further forbearance will difficult to achieve . the previous forbearance period was only achieved via a high - level washington summit which does not appear likely to happen this weekend .
additional financing for dwr will not be automatically approved by the legislature . the non - energy expenditures of the california government are now at risk , as there is not yet a rate structure in place to recover the costs being expended on power from the general fund .
2 . state to take 2 / 3 of utility debt
while the state seems to have succeeded in forcing the utility parents to eat close to one third of the $ 12 billion debt , a final deal has been held up on two fronts . first , it is still unclear what the state will get in return for the utility debt . it is possible that there will be a mix of stock warrants and / or transmission assets . a takeover of the transmission assets seems more likely than a takeover of the hydro assets . the value of these assets still has not been settled . second , while the state will be on the hook for $ 9 billion , it is not clear what mixture of rate hikes and revenue bonds will be used to recover the cost of the bailout . finally , expect davis and other california politicians to work to minimize rate hikes ( although the edison / pg & e v . cpuc case on monday is likely to force their hand here ) and to do everything possible to avoid the appearance of a bailout . the tangible transmission assets are more politically attractive than the nebulous stock warrants .
no price has been set at which the state would purchase the utilities ' transmission assets , which are currently valued at approximately $ 7 - $ 8 billion . all of the proceeds though cannot be used to pay off the utilities ' debts , as some of the money would go to existing bondholders . however , ipp sources advise that there is already a bid on the table for these transmission assets that is higher than what the state would offer .
3 . long - term contracts
as noted by the governor in his announcement tuesday , only 500 mw of the 5 , 000 mw of power contracted for can come on - line immediately . much of the remainder reportedly was contracted in long - term purchases from suppliers who are building power plants . some of this will come on - line in approximately two years .
assemblyman keeley expressed frustration that he has received a "" tablet from on high "" from governor davis that there must not be a rate increase . this means that the state must acquire power , not from internal sources or from the market , but through long - term contracts at 7 . 39 cents / kwh . this allows 1 . 213 cents to amortize socal edison ' s undercollection from the recent rate freeze period . ( the number is slightly different for pg & e . ) this assumption is based on a natural gas price of $ 7 . 90 in 2001 and $ 5 . 15 in 2005 , and an efficiency heating rate of 10 , 000 - 12 , 000 in 2001 and 7 , 200 in 2005 .
these numbers were quoted to industry sources , who felt they were unrealistic . these sources quoted the 2001 price of natural gas as $ 9 . 00 - $ 9 . 50 . the sources agreed with keeley ' s number for the 2001 efficiency heating rate , but they felt that 7 , 200 in 2005 was very optimistic unless an enormous amount of new generation capacity comes on line .
according to keeley ' s numbers and assuming the filed rate case is settled at $ 7 billion rather than $ 12 billion , it would take 5 to 6 years to amortize all of the utility undercollection . a settlement to this case will need to be reached so that the state can figure out how much to charge for power in order to amortize the undercollection . however , since assemblyman keeley ' s numbers are unrealistic , a rate increase will be necessary .
4 . air quality district exemptions
there have been a few bills introduced to provide exemptions from aqmd ( air quality management district ) regulations - - ab 20 x , ab 28 x , ab 31 x . also , republicans have been asking the governor to lift the environmental regulations and immediately site the facility in san jose that was denied by the local government .
currently there is no contemplation of loosening the aqmd compliance restrictions . the legislature will not allow "" dirtier "" plants to
come on - line . however , there might be a change in the means of implementation in southern california by moving away from the
use of credits ( this apparently drives up the cost of gas - fired power ) .
5 . democratic moderates pressured by consumer advocates
the moderate left ( sen . burton , the puc , consumer activists ) is afraid of harvey rosenfield and his consumers movement . this is not just because of his initiative . more important from their perspective , his initiative puts him and the far left in a position to challenge and defeat the moderates in the next election . thus , democrats in the legislature will feel pressured to distance themselves from davis and slow down any further rate increases or bailout .
6 . eminent domain would have a limited effect
the threats by burton to seize generation assets to insure continued power supply are limited . they only apply to california suppliers . a
federal order would be needed to seize assets from out - of - state suppliers . there are also canadian suppliers ( such as bc hydro ) who are essentially untouchable .
7 . smaller ipps feeling the squeeze
many of the smaller ipps , which account for approximately 2500 mw of production , appear to be within a few days of running out of cash .
ab lx may be amended , possibly sometime this week , to give the smaller producers credit support .",NO_IGNORE

as we discussed , the cnl 4 . 0 pc libraries are not license managed . version
5 will be . the pc version 4 . 0 can be installed on a network drive and
called from networked pcs . as expected , we would ask that enron honor the
license agreement by allowing only the number of simultaneous uses
permitted
by the license . version 5 . 0 will be license managed and can be licensed as
node locked or floating .
with regard to unix licensing , the current version of cnl for unix is
license managed . it can be licensed as node locked or floating . if you
install the libraries on a unix server as node locked , the number of
simultaneous sessions on that server is not limited except by the
capabilities of the machine . a floating unix license would be checked out
by the individual user to be executed on a local machine .
also as mentioned , your investment is protected by allowing you to upgrade
in the future by paying only the price difference between your current and
desired platforms . this upgrade option only applies to licenses covered
under support .
if you have any additional questions , please let me know . i look forward
to
providing you the best math and statistical libraries available today to
help you solve your problems and understand your data .

subject : re : amendment to im ii ppa
i spoke to mike and he had stated that he is in agreement with you on the banking provisions and their original intent . we also agree that if we assign the ppa to an affiliate the enron corp guarantee will follow .
so you have two remaining points to address which can be managed outside of epmi .
( i ) the right to assign to a bbb - or above . joe has read the dash which also indicates a bbb - assignment provision . i think this is something that the lenders should be able to price for you .
( ii ) the curtailment issue which is a buyer / aep issue which should be solved by them managing this risk through curtailment credits or some other means through their portfolio as mentioned by tod in our meeting .
we obviously can price these if necessary as indicated by kevin in his previous note to ensure you are making the right decision . the contract is worth around $ 11 mm today .
joe has been working with the finance guys on indian mesa ii and should be able to offer some assistance , but unless the economics state we should change the epmi contract as the pricing from the lenders and aep is greater than kevin ' s i think we are done .
let me know if not .

subject : re : amendment to im ii ppa
kevin ,
ewc requires three clarifications to the ppa in order to get the project financed and sold . all previously requested amendments proposed by the equity purchaser have been dropped , and ewc will take the resulting pricing reduction .
i want to make sure you understand how minor these three clarifications are . these clarifications conform to the original deal and are not changes to the deal .
1 . banking provisions . ewc and epmi agreed that energy and renewable energy credits ( "" recs "" ) produced by the indian mesa ii wind generating facility in any year in excess of the annual minimum quantity would , on a cumulative basis , offset any deficiencies of energy and recs in subsequent years . section 4 . 04 of the agreement does not clearly provide the cumulative carryover mechanism which was contemplated by the parties . ( this section originally provided for the carryover , but in an effort to simplify the language , the aggregate carryover concept was clouded . ) both the project lenders and the proposed equity purchaser have required that the point be clarified . there has never been a disagreement between epmi and ewc on the intention of the carryover banking provisions . epmi ' s most recent refusal to make this clarification now appears to be a change in the original deal
2 . grid curtailment ewc and epmi drafted the contract with specific provisions relating to termination resulting from grid curtailment , section 5 . 04 . there is an ambiguity in that grid curtailment could also be covered under the termination provision relating to force majeure under section 5 . 02 . this inconsistency is the problem . neither ewc nor epmi were to pay damages to the other party in the event of grid curtailment . the proposed equity purchasers have requested that the force majeure provisions of the ppa be clarified to make it clear that extended grid curtailment would not give rise to termination payments . this clarification is consistent with the original intent of the parties and is not a change to the deal .
3 . epmi credit support . epmi ' s obligations under the ppa are guaranteed by enron . the indian mesa ii ppa permits epmi to assign the ppa to certain affiliates without consent of the seller . any assignment by epmi would not relieve it of its duties and obligations under the contract , and the enron guarantee would remain in place . however , the project lenders have required clarification that the enron guarantee would either explicitly remain in place or that the assignee would have a credit quality at least as good as enron corp ' s credit quality . the project lender ' s have also requested that the termination payment provisions be clarified to provide that any substitute ppa used to calculate a termination payment would also need to be with a party that had a credit quality similar to enron corp ' s , since that is the credit that is supporting the indian mesa ii ppa . this will not affect the value of the contract to a third party since enron bears this obligation unless released by the project .
under the dispute resolution provisions of the ppa we could certainly pursue declaratory relief under arbitration . our sense is that this does nothing but ensure delay .
from an enron perspective :
? the sale of the equity and the financing of the non - recourse debt on the indian mesa ii project is currently at a standstill due to issues surrounding the ambiguities in the ppa
? while the debt financing for the indian mesa i project is in place ( different offtaker ) the proposed equity sale to aep is linked to the sale of the indian mesa ii project .
? if enron cannot move forward with the financing of the project within the next month , enron will likely end up with approximately $ 153 m less cash at year end than it counted on in its plan , in addition to any decrease in planned earnings
? the after - tax return to enron in a "" hold "" situation is 0 % , due to enron being in the alternative minimum tax position , i . e . it cannot use the tax benefits .
it was clear in the discussions with the city of san antonio that these clarifications would have had no affect on value .

subject : re : amendment to im ii ppa
i would like to make the message even more clear . epmi will not be making any changes , amendments , clarifications , interpretations , etc . to the current indian mesa ii ppa . therefore , any proposed purchaser of the indian mesa facility must evaluate the contract based on their own legal and commercial interpretation .
i don ' t think it is productive to spend any more time on this discussion . we will continue provide enron wind with the ppa value on a daily basis such that total shareholder value is maximized for any proposed wind transaction ( sale of company and / or sale of im project ) .
please feel free to call me to discuss ( 713 - 853 - 5035 )

we are not interested in these changes to the ppa . these changes will weaken the language in the contract for us ( i . e . improve it for aep that is probably why they are asking for the "" clarifications "" ) . i will be out next week on vacation so please address any further concerns in my absence to kevin presto . regards , - mike

mike : attached is our proposed amendment to the indian mesa ii ppa . it deals with the banking clarification ( section 4 . 04 amendments ) , grid curtailment clarification ( section 5 . 02 amendments ) , guaranty clarifications requested by the lenders ( section 5 . 05 and 9 . 03 amendments ) , and the ercot amendment ( section 3 . 04 amendments ) that we have discussed . please note that the ercot restriction would permit international sales , such as to mexico , but would otherwise restrict epmi ' s sales of energy from the wind facility to other locations within ercot . in the preparation of this draft , we used the same amendment that was previously sent to you by e - mail on 8 / 22 / 01 . that e - mail had a redline with it to show the changes to the banking provisions . please let us know whether this draft is acceptable or whether you have any questions or comments on the amendment . thanks

shirley ,
following up on the telephone conversation , please see the attached
spreadsheet for pricing information plus important information about "" true
world "" copy speeds .
pricing was centered on the 42 . 315 k per month volume band so that you can get
a good feel for copier expenditure based on average month volumes . i have
left the spreadsheet "" unprotected "" so that you can play with the volume
figures and see how this changes the price overall + how the "" cost per image ""
is affected by volume changes .
? pricing spreadsheet : under "" notes "" towards under the pictures .
the "" true world "" copy speed information has been supplied by buyers lab
incorporated , which is an independent testing house that rates office
equipment , including copiers and publishes their findings on a quarterly
basis . unfortunately they have not released their findings on the canon ir 550
as testing is not yet complete .
? copier speeds : @ the end of the notes - mail
{ these include 1 - 1 , 1 - 2 and duplexing + detail on completion of "" sets "" }
as you will see , duplexing speeds are widely different across the various
manufacturers equipment & the "" true world "" copy speeds are a soft $ expense
which impacts the true cost of running a copier .

"vince ,
i quite agree , we have to separate out price and position ,
and that is what we have done with the historical simulations / evt ideas . we
have taken today ' s delta - gamma , hold that frozen , and gone back historically
and looked at price changes and see what happens to portfolio changes .
garman and company have looked at gross historical portfolio changes , which i
agree is not the best approach , due to the artificiality imposed by largest
net open positions ( nop ) , such as we have seen recently .

tanya , naveen ,
just a thought . changes in the portfolio values may combine both the changes
of prices and positions .
this happens if one tracks changes in the value of our historical gas
portfolio . a big jump in
the volumetric position from day to day , combined with a moderate price
movement may produce an
observation that looks artificially big .
if the volumetric position was frozen , it ' s just a scaling factor and there
should be
no discrepancy between your numbers . of course , the correct approach
is to separate the price process from the position changes .

i am trying to answer the question : what is the appropriate stochastic
process to model the behavior
of commodities ' prices in our var model . so what i do care about is the
behavior of log - returns .
any help is appreciated .

tanya ,
we care about portfolio value changes , not log - returns of a
single contract , which has extremes in the behavior and can be fit to a
fat - tailed distribution . a 1 . 20 basis move , with 500 bcf position , is an
extreme event , anyway you slice it . in the literature , as elsewhere , i agree
for a single contract log - returns , they don ' t divide by vols .

naveen ,
i got ngi - socal prices for prompt , prompt + 1 , . . . , prompt + 59 contracts .
for each contract i calculated moving average based on 21 log - returns as
well as moving volatility . then i calculated normalized log - returns :
[ return ( t ) - ave ( t ) ] / vol ( t )
and compared the results to normal distribution .
i could not find fat tails !
volatility changes a lot from day to day , so when people look at
log - returns ( not normalized ) it seems that there fat tails ( big spikes , large
returns more frequent than normal ) ,
which comes from the fact that volatility is not constant ( at all ) .

"dear tanya :
it was a great pleasure to have met you . i very much enjoyed the interview and your insightfull questions .
i am keenly aware that many of the methods that i discussed with you yesterday are unique , new and not reported elsewhere . this is true both about the work i did in whole yield curve interest rate pricing as well as garch . the innovations stem from the extensive numerical analysis experience that i have both in turbulence physics as well as finance . they entailed considering the problem from its raw formulation , mathematical analysis , physical interpretation , taylored numerical method development , software writting and develoment and data management .
as to why i have not yet published anything the answer is that the driver in my work has been adding value to the business not publishing . publishing is however an option that has always been open with my former supervisor who is aware of the work that i did .
i not however that these results were possible only by exploring to the utmost extent the mathematics , finance , software design and data managemnet aspects of the problem . absence of any of these aspects is likely to cripple performance and execution .
please recall that as good as they were the performance measures that i mentioned to you were for a single processor machine . vastly better can be achieved with both soft parallelism ( multithreading ) as well as hard parallelism ( heterogenous network ) . this fo course allows us to step up the reach of the models used .
in fact i know for a fact that better can be done than what i mentioned in the interview . from work that i have been doing on the integration of the swaption volatility surface on the whole yield curve interest rate model itm and otm instruments can be included in both the callibration , pricing and hedging .
i look forward hearing back from you soon and particularly to the opportunity of us cooperating .

gerald / eric -
i have a couple of questions regarding tglo transport contract
012 - 88494 - 202 . we are currently delivering a volume of 28 . 000 mm into various
midcon interconnects on this contract that are designated to go to
reliant / entex for the purpose of heating hisd schools . the transport
contract stipulates different rates for this delivery depending on whether
the gas is intended for state facilities or not . my first question , then ,
is : are hisd schools considered state facilities ? and , if hisd schools are
considered state facilities , does the fact that this gas is being delivered
to them via reliant / entex utilizing midcon ' s pipe make any difference ?
i am asking these questions not only to assure that we are recouping the
correct transport rate , but also to determine what the consequences might be
if i interrupt this delivery . we are having difficulty getting enough gas
into midcon to cover our entex noms and i am just exploring my options . i
would also expect that this volume should decrease when hisd closes for the
christmas holidays - does the fact that this is an it agreement give me enough
leverage to cut this nom if tglo does not do so voluntarily ?

shona ,
just to summarise the main thrust of our discussion yesterday :
preliminary p / l due @ lpm local ( 7 pm houston )
as i understand , sally is the sponsor of this project with the goal of
presenting skilling with a dpr by 8 a . m . the following day .
i have asked all mgmrs to assess how we can achieve this . we will discuss
this in meeting early next week .
a major obstacle that we face , is limited it resource to re - engineer and
expedite our processes . this will require buy in of senior mgmt and
commercial business heads to reallocate resources away from current projects .
( james to discuss . )
additionally , there are certain dependencies on depts in houston , which are
prerequisite for dpr completion in london . notably continental power has a
dependency on portcalc it support in houston .
shift work and 16 hour days are more difficult ( not impossible ) to implement
in london as the labour market is very tight and such working conditions
would make enron very uncompetitive as a prospective employer . bear in mind
that we compete directly with all the big investment houses for the best
talent . a decision to use shift ' s would have to be made at the highest level
considering the possible implications on the corporate image . this might
suggest that additional it resource is the only feasible way forward .
i could easily say that we can do the preliminary p / l but i assume that we
wish to retain the qualatitive features of our reporting . therefore i have
tempered my comments to reflect what i believe are real issues that we in
london will have to address . we will get back to you with our proposals . ,
after we have discussed these issues early next week .
same day dpr
this is the long term goal and is such a large project that it would have to
be sponsored at the highest level here in europe .

subject : re : two major inconsistencies in ferc ' s most recent refund order and the nov 1 and dec 15 orders
hi dave ,
of course the decision is politically motivated . but aren ' t they all ? it ' s just that now it ' s our ox being gored .
in general , review of agency decisions by courts is very deferential , i . e . , court ' s give agencies a lot of discretion - - - which is why it is often difficult to overturn an agency decision . but if a court concludes that the agency ' s action was "" arbitrary and capricious "" it may overturn the decision . our argument would be that ferc is acting arbitrarily in its most recent order because it has disregarded - - - without explanation - - - its earlier rulings in this case . it ' s no slam dunk , but it ' s the best argument we have . we will never win an argument in any court that ferc "" could have "" or "" should have "" crafted its order a certain way ; a court will almost always say , "" the agency can fix the energy crisis in any way it deems fit . "" however , courts take a dim view of inconsistent agency decisions because it demonstrates a lack of constitutional due process .
as for the public ' s opinion of enron as a profiteer - - - for better or worse it ' s already established . and no matter what action we take , davis will cast a negative spin on it . so why not fight for our interests ? the stakes in this order are worth it . this recent order sets a bad precedent for the future viability of our business model ( power marketing ) ; it ' s hard to run a business when the government can reach back in time and recalculate your selling price with complete disregard of your costs . the generators get to offset refunds with input costs , we should be able to use our purchased power costs . i don ' t see much downside for us to argue that ferc should keep its word that ( 1 ) refunds can only be ordered within 60 days , and ( 2 ) all sellers are entitled to marginal costs . we are just holding the commission to its promise . at a minimum , the commission needs to explain why it ignored and reversed itself on its earlier holdings .
these are good questions . have a good weekend .

steve ,
aside from the fact that the entire play by the ferc in the last 3 months has been purely politically motivated , are we going to challenge the latest rulings in court ? can we challenge this apparent lack of consistency ( memory loss ) ?
if we were to challenge do you think the general "" public "" opinion and impression of enron as a henious profiteer from houston would negate any potential gains made from making such a challenge ?
just curious about what your thoughts / planned recommendation are .

subject : two major inconsistencies in ferc ' s most recent refund order and the nov 1 and dec 15 orders
the ferc apparently has a very short memory :
1 . in its dec . 15 , 2000 order , ferc clarified that liability for refunds would only last for 60 days after the transaction was filed with ferc . how can ferc now say that transactions from nov . 1 through april 26 are subject to refund ? the dec . 15 order said that only transactions that were identified by commission staff for further review would be subject to continued refund liability . otherwise , refund potential for transactions over $ 150 / mwh would close after 60 days . presumably , liability for transactions under $ 150 / mwh would close after 60 days , too .
here is the excerpt from the dec . 15 order :
"" we clarify that , unless the commission issues some form of notification to a seller that its transaction is still under review , refund potential on a particular transaction will close 60 days after the initial report is filed with the commission . the institution of a 60 - day period for the review of the transactions will provide sellers with the certainty they request and allows a reasonable period for analysis by staff . "" dec . 15 order at 58 .
2 . in its nov . 1 order , ferc said that it would limit refund liability to seller ' s marginal costs or legitimate and verifiable opportunity costs . ferc now says that marketers cannot use their purchased power costs - - - much less opportunity costs - - - to offset potential refunds .
from the nov . 1 order : "" however , should we find it necessary to order refunds , we will limit refund liability to no lower than the seller ' s marginal costs or legitimate and verifiable opportunity costs . "" nov . 1 order at 39 .

liz ,
i work for anthony dayao as part of the ees it group but formerly was in enron net works under steve stock and met louise briefly in 1999 . i ' m in the middle of the rice university executive mba program and for one of our final exam questions , we are permitted to consult internal resources . the question is regarding how we ( enron ) have used the internet to differentiate ourselves from other organizations ( competitors ) in the industry . during our rice mba classes , eol was brought up several times so it ' s considered very highly by the school . i would be remiss if i didn ' t mention its strengths during our exam .
my professor has provided me assurance in writing ( email ) that any answer will not be published .
i appreciate louise ' and your time in helping me on this school exam paper .

the sales contract between ena & praxair was assigned to hplc eff / 10 / 1 / 99 .
the only remaining contract between ena & praxair is a master financial
agreement .
does praxair really need to remain under ena or is it okay under hplc ? if it
really needs to be under ena , we will need to un - do the 10 / 1 / 99 assignment to
hplc or set - up a new contract between ena & praxair .

could tell me if i ' m on the right track & if this will get everything for
which she is looking .
she is trying to draft a long - term transport / storage agreement between ena &
hplc which will allow ena to move the gas to their markets . in order to
accomplish this , she needs to know all of the sales to customers that ena is
doing off of hpl ' s pipe .
i had scott mills run a report from sitara showing all ena buy / sell activity
on hpl since 7 / 99 . if i eliminate the buys & the desk - to - desk deals , will
this give me everything that i need ?
are there buy / sell deals done with ena on hpl ' s pipe that wouldn ' t show up in
sitara ? someone mentioned something about deals where hpl transports the gas
on it ' s own behalf then ena sells it to a customer at that same spot - -
? ? ? ? ? do deals like that happen ? would they show up in sitara ?
is there anything else that i ' m missing ? i ' m not real familiar with how some

"dear rick ,
thanks for the update . i appreciate your input as i do not know what your
discussions with rick buy have been . to address your points below :
1 ) i agree that your team should be involved in the planning of each
individual review although i am under the impression that ted & sally ( by
proxy cassandra and i ) would set the scope & timing of the reviews while your
group would be looped in to the planning for each individual process . if my
understanding is incorrect , please let me know .
2 ) i agree that it would be useful for everyone to attend all meetings .
however , due to the limited time we have from arriving at the doorstep to
delivery of the report to ted and sally , your group really has to be focused
on completing the deal test . we don ' t need three different people
obtaining the same information at the same meetings . if there has been a
change in your group ' s role from what i originally understood ( we need lower
level people from your team who would be able to execute a deal test ) , we
may have to add additional resources to do the actual deal test to ensure it
is done on time ( by the time we leave the site ) .
3 ) agreed - i ' d like to hear what donna and mike neeves have resolved as far
as the database is concerned before we meet again .

shona : thank you for your memo . i think it is a good idea to define roles

initiative to do so . however , i do have the following comments :
1 ) i have some accountability to rick buy for the success of this effort ,
therefore i ( or my designee ) need to be involved in doorstep pre - planning
and post - mortem . i will be involved in reviewing the final report before
presentation and will attend the meeting when the report is presented to buy
and causey .
2 ) i realize that in the interest of getting a review done timely it is
sometimes necessary to "" divide and conquer "" . however , where logistically
possible , i believe that it makes sense for my people to be involved in
meetings held with commercial personnel . this facilitates understanding
operations , document flow , points of contact , report writing as well as
furthering our goal of educating "" multi - functional "" people so that we can
continue to reduce the resources necessary to perform these reviews .

the database . let ' s schedule another meeting with cassandra and donna .

"on friday , steve cooper left the following voicemail for employees . since some employees do not have access to voicemail , we are providing the following transcript of that message .

voicemail
from : steve cooper
date : friday , march 1 , 2002
hi everybody . it ' s steve cooper . it ' s friday afternoon , march 1 . i hope everybody has had a great week . i want to update everybody on a number of things that have gone on this week , so that you all will be fully in the loop .
the week started in a rough - and - tumble fashion . i went to a town meeting monday night to meet with a number of our ex - colleagues . their disappointment , upset and anger is very understandable . i , along with the entire management team , have committed that we are going to try to do whatever we can to fashion a reasonable resolution to their various issues .
in order to make sure that those that are truly in need have something to fall back on , we asked the court later in the week and got the judge to approve an emergency $ 5 million fund . we are now going to fish around for an independent administrator to evaluate the needs and disperse those dollars to former employees . i wanted you to be aware of that . i really do appreciate and understand everybody ' s upset .
last friday , february 22 , we presented to the creditors ' committee a formal proposal on a retention and severance program . as can be expected , there was some push back from the committee - - there were issues about some of the data , there were requests for additional data and further clarification .
the creditors ' committee formed a subcommittee . we provided to them more data . jeff mcmahon and i met with them on wednesday , february 27 , and we met with them again on thursday , february 28 . we are scheduled to meet with them again on monday and tuesday to resolve all the open issues and to get the full support and endorsement of the creditors ' committee on this program .
i have indicated to the subcommittee that getting a plan in place is jeff ' s and my highest priority . it is not right or fair for anyone to be in a state of ongoing uncertainty about their future , their future compensation , and any financial safety net , so we are going to have to move on this at light speed . i told the creditors ' subcommittee and asked that they tell the full committee that we want to be in a position by the week of march 11 to motion this up to the court . i ' ll keep you posted on progress . i am comfortable that the committee wants to put in place the retention and severance program and now we are just working out the bugs . hopefully , by the time we have the employee meeting , we can walk through the composition of the program in detail .
the powers that be - management in conjunction with the human resources group - are working on merit increases and promotions . hopefully all the details of a program will be finalized next week . then , the process is typically that business unit managers begin to calculate salary increases . and it works its way through the review , approval and communication process . so hopefully , we ' ll have that all resolved in the next week or two and everyone will know where they stand with respect to promotions and merit increases .
we reached an accord with the astros this week to repatriate to enron $ 2 . 1 million for the release of our rights to the naming contract . it is a shame we won ' t be in a position to support the naming of the field , but it is probably in the best interest of the estate . i got a great suggestion from one of our colleagues about auctioning enron field signs and contributing net proceeds to the ex - employees ' fund . i ' d like your input on that . i thought it was a great idea and very generous .
we are moving forward with plans for an employee meeting later this month . hopefully i ' ll be able to meet many of you there . i ' ve tried to get around to say hello here and there . and again , i would encourage you if you have any questions , concerns or issues just give me an email or a buzz . sometimes it takes a few days for me to get back to you , but i ' m making a very concerted effort to answer everybody ' s inquiries .
other than that i don ' t have a lot to report . we ' ll continue to hammer out with the committee the retention program . hopefully by next friday i ' ll be able to report very substantial progress in this area . i want to thank everybody for their efforts , all their hard work and their focus on moving things forward .
one other thing ?
we did have a bank meeting on thursday afternoon . we have described to the banks what we believe is a very reorganizable entity here . we ' ll be sharing more about that at the employee meeting . i told the bank group , and it was echoed by management , that we believe there is a reorganizable , viable entity in enron ' s future . i ' ll bring you all fully up to speed on that at the employee meeting .
anyway , as i was saying ?
thanks so much for all your hard work , your efforts , your dedication . i hope you have a great weekend . i ' ll chat with next week .",NO_IGNORE

here in japan , i am collaborating with my colleges on new classification
techniques . suppose you have some data set ( e . g . , a data set of financial
records of companies ) and you want to rate the companies based on this ( or
some other information ) . linear programming and semi - definite programming
methods are used for this purpose . with these techniques we are able to
calculate credit rating of investment companies ( aaa , bbb ,  ( ) . similar
techniques can be used for scoring of credit card applications and other
classification problems .
i am interested in applied projects in energy , risk management , and financial
engineering area . i will be happy to collaborate with you on this subject . i
am looking for financial support for phd students who may work on your

our supply comes from apache & williams
our market typicially is the plant ( tenaska iv partners )
if the plant is down , brazos utility has the right to the gas if they want it
if brazos does not call for the gas , then we will sell off to whomever we can
we just get a flat fee on this gas per mmbtu , whether it goes to the plant or
not
daren farmer knows the specifics about the deal
hope this helps , call with any questions .

a short follow up on the p + options .
attached is a chart showing historical correlations for calendar spreads
between futures contracts . it shows correlation over four different time
horizons up to the roll of the nearest contract in each pair . as you can
see the level is usually higher than 0 . 98 and often near 0 . 99 . if our
current book of "" index p + "" options were re - marked at a 98 % correlation , it
would result in a reduction in m - t - m value of about $ 78 million according to

"though there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding whether and when davis will call back the california legislature to address the edison mou , here ' s the latest information we have .
faced with horrible polling , an unwilling legislature , an uncooperative california puc , and a wily leader of the state senate ( burton ) , davis is now considering delaying any action to call back the legislature .
rumors of a delay come despite davis ' statements that he would call them back next week .
we received the information about a likely delay from an edison svp who ' s working with administration staff to come up with a deal that the legislature can finally swallow .
it ' s edison ' s view that the earliest davis would now call the legislature back is end of next week , with early the following week being most likely .
at this point , the chance remains that davis may be forced to throw up his hands and call the whole thing off , leaving edison to follow pg & e into chapter 11 .
in the meantime , negotiations between davis ' staff , and staff from the senate and assembly continue .
we ' ll report back with information as we get it .

there seems to be a problem with mips while trying to actualize
the january 2000 data ( y 2 k related ) . in order to actualize jan
pops has to manually load the actual files into pops , the
side effect of this is that some of the feb data may be loaded
with numbers that are old . this will be rectified as we complete
loading the jan actuals and then load the most recent mips
measured prelim numbers for feb .
pops is currently processing the mips files in the order they
were received , we should be done with this today . please inform

"language
below is an update from the weekend ' s activities .
the group negotiating the core / noncore proposal met over the weekend to attempt to put the proposal into legislative language / format .
the product produced thus far is generally sloppy and ill - drafted and the individual facilitating the group is working tonite to integrate the comments provided and discussions that took place today . he will distribute a new draft by noon tomorrow ( pdt ) .
the plan as it currently stands is to deliver a product to hertzberg by cob tomorrow ( monday ) .
as expected , some in the group are attempting to "" recontract "" certain portions of the original deal , but those attempts are generally at the margin .
the dwr contracts remain a key impediment to any deal .
senator burton has still not definitively committed to a conference committee to produce a bill to deliver to davis .
in addition , the legislation to create a dedicated rate component to service the bonds to repay the state budget for power purchased by dwr ( and de - link the bonds from the dwr contracts ) may be on a slower track than folks thought initially .
will have more information tomorrow on where burton and the bond legislation stand .

are looking to achieve here . in broad terms i am looking to do the following :
update all on project we set hr associate group and their recommendations

we should also incorporate ( see my thumb nail sketch notes inspired by
associate group below ) .
reaffirm commitment to take this project forward and agree :
team for doing so

methodology for agreeing final version .
my ambition is that we ( but in particular andrea , bob , gerry , tim , tana , dan ,

done in this area ) all agree to contribute to this and get it done without
the need for a formation of a new team or group . obviously everyone welcome

tana / dan ,
can you cicruclate a summary of your teams proposals to this group so we they
can review before meeting . could you also agree within your team who you

subject : 1997 risk paper on pricing of electricity derivatives
hello vince ,
my name is bernard murphy - i received your e - mail address from les clewlow ,
who was my phd supervisor at the financia options research centre at warwick
business school . i ' ve just finished my phd on electricity price jump
diffusions : a theoretical and empirical study in incomplete markets -
hence my interest in electricity price modelling and derivative pricing . i
was looking to get hold of a copy of your 1997 paper , which has recently
come to my attention :
"" the challenge of pricing & risk - managing electricity derivatives "" , the us
power market , risk publications , pp . 149 - 171 .
and les suggested that i contact you directly ( les is travelling at present
and doesn ' t have an electronic copy available ) to request an e - copy .
incidentally , i am lecturer in finance / financial mathematics at university
of limerick ( ireland ) and have taken a year out to work for caminus uk ,
where i am working on introducing and developing a markets - based approach
( spark - spread ) to real asset valuations in the uk power industry .
thanks in advancve

"wes ,
as we discussed on friday , i think that there is merit to your arguments
regarding the release in prudency in north america . however , this may alter
the way we articulate the relative liquidity of our positions to banks and
ratings agencies . de facto , we will be saying that our balance sheet and
income statement reflect an ability to liquidate gas and power in north
america at the mid with no adverse effects . while this may be true ,
typically these types of institutions see the result of liquidating much more
liquid portfolios , i . e . , they will not believe that we have perfect
liquidity . i believe that we can satisfy both accounting and credit
considerations if we maintain an ability to calculate an "" orderly
liquidation "" under a negative pricing scenario ( basically , multiple horizon
var against a liquidating position ) . this is what we showed moody ' s last
month . the main difference is that the resulting number will be a hit to p & l
as opposed to having reserves against it . this is a long way of saying that
i think it would be a good idea to discuss prudency methodology with both rac
and treasury once you have finalized a course of action .

subject : brazil commercial - * * update version , delete previous * *
david / john - understand the trip will be delayed .
proposal outline has two texts - i . commercial strategy and ii . historical perspective . the org charts will need some discussion - particularly in regard to the strengths and weakness of employed personnel and urgent need for an improved structure .
over the fh 2000 and within the new structure with brett and joao carlos albuquerque in place , the wholesale group and trading desk seems to have made some important strides forward in terms of recruiting some good individuals and , in trading terms , finally executing some fundamental market supply , demand and transmission analysis .
to get into the game quickly and aggressively , though , i think the commercial group needs to hire some senior , local trading expertise . i apoligize , but was unable to get in contact with either of these two guys to set up a possible meeting this week . however , they have the local knowledge , trading competencies and management experience which i consider needed to catalyze the regional effort :
axel hinsch - argentine and cargill employee with several years and broad commodity and financial trading , business development and management experience , including senior trader for the bear stearns emerging markets equity desks in the late 1980 s / early 1990 s . straight up , no ego
argentine country manager .
mark hoffman - swiss / brazilian and glencore employee with several years energy , energy distribution and sugar sector experience ; applied commodity and financial arbitrage experience in the brazilian market . lot less straight forward , but applied knowledge and expertise .
senior originator / trader .
please forward any input about your interest in scheduling a meeting either open here or in houston during the week of nov 20 .
for some perspective on my experience at enron , let me explaing that i have been working in enron networks in the region from q 2 ' 00 and therefore much less formally invovled with the trading ( brazil spot market ) and wholesale pricing , tarrif issues etc . , . . than at the end of fyl 999 when i was directly involved in developing our effort to get in the game in understanding the spot price formula calculations and exploring arbitrage opportunities in the wholesale market .
i ' ve attached my resume for some perspective on my background and capability to critically review the commercial ( trading and marketing ) and managerial issues involving the past and future opportunities .",NO_IGNORE

"the commission discussed its market based rate policy at today ' s meeting . they did not vote out an order today , but expect to take up this issue again next meeting . the staff memo recommended the following :
for an interim period , ferc will deal with pending requests for market based rates and with triennial reviews of those rate authorizations , using a new test called the "" supply margin assessment "" ( also called a jazzed up version of the hub and spoke test ) where a seller ' s capacity will be reviewed against the generation reserve margin in a market . the test takes into account constraints based on ttc . if the capacity of a seller is not necessary to meet peak demand , the seller does not have market power . this test is applicable to all markets that are not part of an existing rto or iso . for those selling into an rto / iso , the ferc will continue to allow market based rates subject to the market monitor and mitigation .
staff also recommends that ferc initiate a section 206 investigation to require each seller with market based rate authority to change its tariff by adding a provision stating that if the seller acts in an anticompetitive manner , the ferc can require refunds . through questioning by commissioner massey , it was revealed that , even if a seller did not engage in bad behavior , but sold into a disfunctional market , refunds could be required . in the staff memo , apparently staff had left vague the definition of anticompetitive behavior in order to be able to interpret it most broadly . however , commissioners asked staff to better define the anticompetitive actions that could trigger refunds . this policy will be brought up again at the next commission meeting on october 11 . it will be issued as a proposed action , giving parties an opportunity to comment within 15 days and then also file reply comments , final action is expected within 60 - 90 days .
last , for the long - term , ferc will hold outreach meetings looking for answers as to how to detect market power and what to do when it is detected .
since the interim measure is only a "" snapshot "" approach according to commissioner massey , he is willing to support it only along with the above described tariff provision . commissioner breathitt is very uncomfortable with an open refund requirement , stating that it adds to regulatory uncertainty at a time when the commission is most interested in giving certainty to the industry in order to assure reliability .",NO_IGNORE

dear christian friends ,
greetings in the name of our lord jesus !
we have two very urgent prayer requests . our dear friend and a brother , david
gatewood , the son of late otis gatewood , has been recently diagnosed a
pancreas cancer . david and his wife sandy were two of the first people who
introduced dragica and me to christ and his church over thirty years ago . in
1969 they came to croatia ( yugoslavia at that time ) , as missionaries , with
another couple , bud and beverly pickl . in order to get their resident visas ,
they enrolled in a croatian language study program . i was their professor at
that time , and we became very good and close friends . david and sandy have
been connected with the lord  @ s work in croatia for all these years . before
leaving croatia in 1972 , they adopted a little croatian girl , whom they
raised with much love . she is a married woman now , and lives in colorado
springs . david and sandy made several trips to croatia during the war , and
david taught seminars on post - war traumatic experiences and the value of a
family . your prayers will be greatly appreciated by many in croatia who love
david dearly .
also , please , put me ( mladen ) on your prayer list . for several months now
i ? ve been having some prostate problems . ten days ago my doctor requested a
biopsy , and i am anxiously waiting to get the results this coming monday .
dragica and i believe god listens and hears ? prayers of his people .
please , join the church in croatia with your prayers .
yours in his love and mercy ,

godbole  , s report unearths absurd calculations , maharashtra could use this to
wriggle out of the dabhol project , sucheta dalal
it is finally quit india time for enron . though the controversial
multinational has denied plans to sell its stake in dabhol power company
( dpc ) , informed sources say that it has sent feelers to china light & power
and others to offload its majority holding . getting out of india may be the
best course for enron . though it has threatened a fight and invoked political
force majeure , the energy review committee headed by madhav godbole will
certainly weaken its case . the committee points out that the many
 & infirmities  8 in the dpc approval process brings into question the  & propriety
of the decisions  8 .
it is clear that the $ 20 m that enron spent on educating india  , s
policy - makers and bureaucrats did not even teach them the basics of
techno - economic appraisal or due procedure with regard to large international
contracts . the committee says it is  & troubled with the failure of governance
that seems to have characterised almost every step of the decision making
process on matters relating to dpc . the failure of governance has been broad ,
across different governments at different points of time , at both the state
and the central level , and across different agencies associated with
examining the project and at both the administrative and political levels . it
strains belief to accept that such widespread and consistent failure to
execute assigned responsibilities is purely co - incidental  8 .
though the committee decided that it is not the proper forum to investigate
these infirmities , its two key members , mr godbole , and former secretary in
the ministry of finance , eas sarma , have asked for a judicial inquiry into
the process of clearing the dpc project . other members felt a judicial
inquiry would delay the negotiation process and  ¬ serve any purpose  8 .
there may be some merit in an argument against a further delay in
renegotiating tariffs or facilitating enron  , s exit , but the report certainly
provides the central vigilance commission ( cvc ) with all the grounds that it
needs to start an investigation .
cvc n vittal has already received innumerable requests to investigate the
deal , especially the beneficiaries of its education campaign . though the
political establishment may be reluctant to set up a judicial inquiry , the
cvc can establish whether there are lapses on the part of  & government
functionaries including political executives  8 and ensure  & appropriate action  8
against them . if it is indeed able to establish  it deliberately uses expensive raw material
( ignoring world bank warnings ) , has worked on fanciful demand - supply
estimates and several legal requirements and permissions .
in fact , the committee has found that the mseb has been paying enron rs 930
crore more than it should every year . this comprises overcharging of rs 253
crore on account of the large regassification plant of which only 42 per cent
of the capacity is used for dpc . there  , s also a rs 100 crore extra billing to
the mseb for shipping and harbour charges although the cost of these
facilities had been included in the capital recovery charge . by charging more
than twice the operations & maintenance rate stipulated by the government of
india , enron collects approximately rs 246 crore extra every year . it has
also been collecting rs 332 crore every year through inflated fuel
consumption claims . enron has been charging at 1878 kcal / kwh under the power
purchase agreement ( ppa ) although the equipment manufacturer has guaranteed
it a much lower consumption rate . this gives it a fat fuel arbitrage
opportunity at the cost of the people of maharashtra .
the committee has also pointed to the strange practice of using four
different exchange rates for different aspects of the project negotiation : a
rate of rs 32 per dollar was assumed for calculating debt service of rupee
loans , rs 34 . 5 per dollar as reference rate for phase - i , rs 39 . 35 per dollar
as reference rate for phase - ii and a curious rs 42 per dollar for calculating
government of india tariff . forcing a reduction of these excessive charges
has nothing to do with contract cancellation . all it needs is tough
negotiation and public pressure on the political establishment .
the godbole committee has established that dpc  , s tariffs can easily be halved
if excess payments are eliminated and unfair conditions such as the
dollarisation of payments , the take - or - pay clause and escrow facility ( which
is in fact hampering mseb  , s reform particularly in power distribution ) are
scrapped . the security of future payments to dpc under the restructured tariff
would be based on increased cash flows from a reformed distribution system .
the committee also gives enron a difficult escape route . it says that if the
multinational finds the conditions for restructuring too onerous , it should
free mseb from its contractual obligations and find buyers outside
maharashtra . the committee has tried to establish another precedent on all
projects negotiated by government :  & the public has a right to know what is
being contracted on their behalf  8 and has recommended that all documents ,
including contracts related to all independent power projects ( ipps ) ,
particularly dpc , should be published by the maharashtra government within
two months .
also , having established that demand - supply estimates by the state government
were fanciful , the committee has asked mseb to defer all negotiations with
power producers until demand levels in the state permit full absorption of
power generation from such ipps . it recommends that such negotiations should
be in accordance with the least - cost plan spelt out by the report . this
should also end the hectic lobbying by reliance ( patalganga ) , mittals
( bhadravati ) , the bses ( saphale ) and others to set up ipps in maharashtra .

dpc board set to authorise president , enron md to issue notice of
termination , sanjay jog
scrapping of power purchase agreement
the board of directors of dabhol power company ( dpc ) , which has already taken
an aggressive posture , has proposed to authorise the enron india managing
director k wade cline and dpc president and chief executive officer neil
mcgregor to issue notices for the termination of power purchase agreement
( ppa ) and transfer of dabhol project in view of continuing default by the
state and central governments and maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) .
the board of directors , which would meet on april 25 in london , also plans to
appoint mr cline as its  & true and lawful attorney - in - fact  8 and authorise him
to represent the company in the negotiation of all project contracts and
financing agreements and their amendments and modifications . top sources told
the financial express that dpc would authorise mr cline and / or mr mcgregor to
serve the preliminary termination notices and transfer notices to the state
and central governments and mseb under clause 17 and schedule 11 of the ppa .
 & in response to the continuing default by the mseb of its payment obligations
under the ppa , the failure of the government of maharashtra to honour
obligations under its guarantee and state support agreement and failure of
the government of india to honour obligations under its counter guarantee ,
the company has sought recourse to dispute resolution and has initiated
conciliation and arbitration proceedings ,  8 the company resolution said .
 & consistent with this recourse to contractual remedies , the company now seeks
the authority to serve preliminary termination notices and transfer notices
pursuant to clause 17 and schedule 11 of the ppa from time to time and at any
time upon the occurrence of an event giving rise to its right to serve such
notices as determined by the company ,  8 the resolution added .
according to the resolution , the directors , the company secretary and
officers of the company and each of them acting individually , are authorised
and empowered to execute and deliver such documents and instruments and take
such other actions as they deem fit to effect the purpose of the resolution ,
in the name and for and on behalf of the company . against this backdrop , the
state government and mseb have been exploring the possibilities of issuing
termination notice to the dpc for its failure to meet the contractual
obligations under the ppa . the state government and mseb sources said that
such a notice could be served by the mseb as dpc has not paid the rebate
( penalty ) of rs 409 crore for misdeclaration and default on the availability
of power on january 28 and february 13 .
the state government and mseb , which reviewed its position on saturday at a
meeting convened by the chief minister vilasrao deshmukh , are of the view
that they have a strong case and substantial grounds to slap the termination
notice to the dpc . the dpc  , s move to appoint mr k wade cline as its  & true and
lawful attorney - in - fact  8 deserves importance especially when the state
government proposes to set up a negotiating committee to cut the per unit
cost and gauge the possibility of sale of dabhol power to the power deficit
states .
mr cline would also be authorised to dispose of equipment that is worn out or
obsolete or other equipment or fuel no longer expected to be used in the
ordinary course in amounts exceeding rs 64 crore or the equivalent in foreign
currency in any financial year . furthermore , mr cline would be in a position
to enter into contracts and take any other actions for purpose relating to
the day - to - day operation of the company  , s business or exercise its rights and
discharge its obligations under the project contracts and the financing
agreements

dpc seeks ok to exit power project , tamal bandyopadhyay & s ravindran
the enron - promoted dabhol power company ( dpc ) is seeking the approval of its
25 lenders to pull the plug on the $ 3 billion power project in maharashtra
tomorrow ( april 23 ) . the meeting has been convened in london at the initiative
of the company . the meeting is crucial as the dpc board is meeting on april
25 in london to discuss the issue of serving a termination notice to the
maharshtra state electricity board ( mseb ) .
dpc cannot go ahead with this unless it gets the go ahead from the lenders .
while bankers said the lenders  , meeting is about the second phase of the
project , which is still under construction , state government officials
clarified that since there is only one ppa covering both phases of the
project , the lenders  , decision will be applicable to the existing phase i
also . the second phase of the project involves 1 , 444 mw generation capacity ,
whereas phase i of 740 mw is already operational .  & according to the loan
agreement , even if only four per cent of the lenders agree to terminate the
contract then dpc can do so ,  8 highly placed sources in the lenders  ,
consortium said from london .
this in effect means that only one lender has to agree for dpc to serve a
preliminary termination notice . following the notice , there is a cooling off
period of six months for both parties ( the mseb and dpc ) to find a mutually
acceptable solution , which may take the form of a re - negotiated ppa , sources
added . sources also said that there are two separate meetings scheduled with
lenders . the monday meeting will be attended by all the lenders including
multilateral funding agencies like japanese exim bank and opic . the second
round of meetings schedule for tuesday will be only with the global loan
arrangers anz investment bank , csfb , abn - amro , citibank and the state bank
of india ( sbi ) . two representatives each from the indian lenders , idbi , icici
and sbi have already left for london .

enron winding up operations in india ?
marred by controversies since inception , the us - based energy major
enron - promoted dabhol power company ( dpc ) board will meet this wednesday ,
april 25 , in london to decide the fate of its 2 , 184 mw project in dabhol ,
including winding up of its operations . "" the top most item on the agenda is
to empower dpc managing director neil mcgregor to wind up operations in the
country , "" state government sources told pti on saturday . when contacted , dpc
spokesperson declined to comment on the agenda of the london meeting and
added , "" i will not like to comment on speculations . ""
sources said a team comprising three top officials of maharashtra state
electricity board ( mseb ) including chairman vinay bansal would attend the
high - profile board meet . bansal told pti that mseb has decided to give a
"" fitting reply "" and present its case concerning the rs . 401 crore penalty
that the loss - making board slapped on dpc on february 28 , for not generating
required power within the stipulated time as per the power purchase agreement
( ppa ) .
this london meet comes two days after the international and domestic
financial institutions sit together ( april 23 ) to discuss dpc ' s future course
of action in the wake of non - payment of dues to the tune of rs . 223 crore by
mseb and also to take into account the aforesaid penalty . over the payment of
dues of december 2000 and january of rs . 102 crore and rs . 111 crore
respectively , sources said , both the state government and mseb had offered to
make a "" protest "" payment as per the ppa , but dpc , india ' s first fasttrack
power project , refused to accept on that condition .
currently , enron india holds 65 per cent in the us $ 900 million dpc project ,
which includes mseb ' s 15 per cent while general electric and bechtel hold 10
per cent each . the controversial "" now on now off "" project began in 1992 but
ran into rough weather after the shiv sena - bjp came to power and was scrapped
only to be revived after renegotiating the ppa . fresh trouble arose in
october last when mseb began defaulting over the "" enormous "" billing following
which dpc invoked the state and centre ' s counter guarantee and also recently
sent three international arbitration notices and invoked the political
"" forced majeure "" implying inability to conform towards any financial
commitment .
dpc had yesterday stated that it had no plans to reduce its stake below 50
per cent but according to enron corp ' s chief executive officer jeff skilling
the company would be interested in talking to potential buyers for its stake .
skilling , according to an international financial daily , said the
multinational continues to see strong growth in north america , europe and
australia indicating a possibility of exiting from india

state for consolidating all dpc arbitration notices , sanjay jog
the maharashtra government has decided to appeal to the centre for
consolidating all arbitration notices served dpc for the  & continuous default
of contractual obligations  8 and name a common arbitrator for the state
government , the centre and mseb . the maharashtra government team led by the
chief minister vilasrao deshmukh , at its meeting with the union finance
minister yashwant sinha and union power minister suresh prabhu on monday ,
also proposes for the appointment of a non - indian arbitrator with a view to
cutting the cost substantially .
during arbitration proceedings initiated by the dpc after the repudiation of
dabhol phase - i by the previous shiv sena - bjp government in 1995 , a non - indian
arbitrator , mr kumara swami was appointed as an arbitrator after a suggestion
by a senior counsel fali nariman . state government sources told the financial
express that it would write a letter to the dpc regarding arbitration
proceedings after monday  , s meetings . the state advocate general goolam
wahanwati will be suggesting a suitable arbitrator for the state and central
government and mseb .
the advocate general will also suggest solicitors and queens counsel , who may
be engaged in london for this purpose . incidentally , mr prabhu , who was
present at the  otherwise it cannot be a
complete exercise , "" he added .
deshmukh and the mseb team are scheduled to meet union finance minister
yashwant sinha and power minister suresh prabhu on monday in new delhi to
discuss the stalemate and find a acceptable solution for the same . "" i am
meeting sinha and prabhu to request them to take an initiative and send
representatives for the negotiations committee , "" he said . deshmukh ' s meeting
with the centre comes at a crucial stage as dpc ' s lenders would be meeting in
london , on the same day , to decide upon the future finances of the
controversy marred 2 , 184 - mw project in dabhol .
moreover , the dpc board is also scheduled to meet on april 25 in london to
decide the fate of its $ 900 million project in dabhol , including winding up
of its operations . the meeting would discuss the topmost item on the agenda ,
which was to empower dpc managing director neil mcgregor to wind up
operations in the country . dpc has already slapped one conciliation notice on
the centre and three arbitration notices on the state government over
non - payment of dues amounting to rs 213 crore plus interest towards the bills
due for the months of december 2000 and january 2001 .
asked whether the centre had send any feel over a possible clubbing together
of the arbitration and conciliation processes , deshmukh replied in the
negative . deshmukh said mseb chairman vinay bansal along with two senior
officials would attend dpc ' s board meeting in london . bansal had said on
sunday that mseb would present its case concerning the rs 401 - crore penalty
that the loss - making board slapped on dpc on february 28 , for not generating
required power within the stipulated time as per the ppa . currently , enron
india holds 65 per cent in the $ 900 - million dpc project , which includes
mseb ' s 15 per cent , while general electric and bechtel hold 10 per cent each .

any such proposal regarding participation of the central power utility . ""

cm takes enron to delhi today
chief minister vilasrao deshmukh will discuss the enron imbroglio with union
finance minister yashwant sinha and union power minister suresh prabhu in
delhi today . he will request the centre to appoint a representative to the
committee that the state government is setting up to carry on discussions and
negotiations regarding the dabhol power project of the us - based enron power
company . today , a special meeting of representatives of all those finanicial
institutions which have extended loans to the dabhol power project is also
being held in london . a meeting of its directors will be held on wednesday to
discuss the fate of the $ 900 million project which has been under a cloud
ever since its inception .
yesterday , mr . prabhu declared at a ' janata darbar ' in thane that the centre
would extend all help to solve the enron crisis . this is in the backdrop of
pending bills to the tune of rs . 213 crore which the state fowarded to the
centre against payments for the months of december 2000 and january 2001 .
confirming that there was no proposal from the state government to handover
the project to the centre , mr . prabhu said that the situation of the
electricity boards in the country was precarious . the centre had decided to
assist maharashtra upto rs . 250 crore every year to improve customer
services .

april 23 , 2001
the real story of dabhol if a judicial probe , suggested by the committee , is
ordered into the enron deal , it could embarrass three governments ranjit
bhushan
"" the committee has prima facie found infirmities in several decisions taken
in respect of the enron project at different points of time by successive
governments and agencies in the centre and state . ""
- - energy review committee headed by former home secretary madhav godbole
this could well be the real enron story
a five - member high - powered committee headed by madhav godbole  * and including
former union economic affairs secretary e . a . s . sarma , hdfc chairman deepak
parekh , teri chairman rajendrapachauri and maharashtra government official
vinay mohan lal  * has recommended a judicial probe into the entire enron power
project deal saying it signified "" the utter failure of governance that seems
to have characterised almost every step of the decision - making process
relating to the dabhol project "" . the report , which was submitted to the
maharashtra government last fortnight and has been acquired by outlook , is
severely critical of former chief minister sharad pawar ( with the congress
then ) , the 13 - day bjp - led union government which reworked the deal in 1996 ,
shiv sena supremo balasaheb thackeray and his government in maharashtra
headed by manohar joshi
"" the utter failure of governance seems to have characterised almost every
step of decision - making relating to the dabhol project . "" madhav godbole
committee report
an investigation , if ordered , could embarrass at least these three
governments the report clearly upholds the allegations of money being paid by
enron to politicians and bureaucrats for clinching the deal . according to the
committee , the deal reveals failure of governance , both at the centre and
state , and across different agencies . "" it strains belief to accept that such
widespread and consistent failure to execute responsibilities is purely
coincidental , "" the report said , proposing a set of measures to be implemented
if something of the project was to be retrieved . godbole and sarma also felt
that the panel should categorically recommend the government of india to
order a judicial inquiry . this was finally adopted by it . says a congress
leader : "" enron could well become the biggest political issue in maharashtra
and put to question liberalisation , particularly in the power sector . ""
the proposal has already struck panic . says ncp ' s praful patel : "" if the enron
decision has at all been detrimental , it is because of the haste with which
phase 2 was cleared by the shiv sena - bjp government . now with the state
having already entered into an agreement with enron , the important thing is
to resolve it amicably . a judicial inquiry will be an eyewash because it ' s
not an issue of corruption but that of perception . ""
pro - market congressmen privately admit that it was their governments at the
centre and the state which invited enron , even though the second phase was
cleared by the bjp - shiv sena combine . says congress spokesperson jaipal
reddy : "" right now we ' re too involved with the parliament deadlock over
tehelka . "" pro - liberalisation congress mps also fear that such witch - hunting
could send wrong signals to foreign investors . non - congress mps from
maharashtra , meanwhile , claim that the godbole committee was instituted with
the express purpose of politicising the enron issue . "" i think i know vilasrao
deshmukh ' s gameplan , "" says an mp from the state . but some mps like congress '
prithviraj chavan question the cloak of secrecy that ' s surrounded the deal :
"" i ' ve maintained for long that there should be a judicial committee to
examine this  8 .
the committee report also says that had the enron project been subjected to a
techno - economic appraisal , as envisaged under provisions of the electricity
supply act of 1948 and related legislations , the infirmities could have been
avoided . since this wasn ' t done , questions about a concerted effort towards
exercising undue influence at every stage of the project are bound to arise ,
the exhaustive 93 - page report points out .
"" i ' d highlight the speed with which the 13 - day vajpayee government cleared
the project minutes before it quit , "" says congress mp prithviraj chavan .
the enron project had been held out as an exemplar of the impending
liberalisation in the early ' 90 s and , despite several controversies , is now
an established power project at dabhol , 150 km south of mumbai . in july 1992 ,
enron signed an mou with the maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) to
set up a 2 , 550 mw station as part of the government ' s ' fast track ' projects .
subsequently , when the shiv - sena - bjp came to power in maharashtra it filed a
writ against the project . this curiously led to renegotiations with enron .
the committee has quoted a bombay high court order on the renegotiated deal .
"" once it ( gom ) decided to revive the project , it acted in the very same
manner its predecessors in office had done . it forgot all about competitive
bidding and transparency . the speed with which the negotiating group studied
the project and made its proposal for renegotiatons , which was accepted by
dabhol , is unprecedented . "" says chavan : "" i would particularly like to
highlight the speed with which the 13 - day vajpayee government at centre
endorsed the renegotiated project minutes before it resigned . ""
since the commissioning of the plant in may 1999 , the mseb has paid rs 1 , 607
crore for the power it has bought from dabhol . if the same watttage of power
had been bought from indian - built power plants fired by indigenous coal , the
payment would have been approximately rs 736 crore . in the first
year - and - a - half of its operation itself , the dpc had drained the maharashtra
exchequer of nearly rs 1 , 000 crore .
the central electricity authority ( cea ) , in fact , pointed out that the dabhol
plant was not the least costly option . the mseb had other inexpensive
alternatives like the four units of kaparkheda , but they were in a
preliminary stage . the report notes : "" . . . if the mseb had made efforts to
seriously pursue these projects , they might not have remained in their
preliminary stages "" . it adds that the members were of the opinion that "" the
mseb and the maharashtra government erred seriously , based on information
available at that time , in proceeding with the dpc as a base - load factor even
when its capacity was reduced . "" the failure seems to have been compounded by
the laxity of the union power ministry , finance ministry and the cea . it
quotes the cea as saying that since the union finance ministry found the
tariff reasonable , no further examination was required
strangely , bal thackeray ' s shiv sena , when it came to power together with the
bjp in maharashtra , filed a writ in the court and then renegotiated the deal .
after the new shiv sena - bjp government took over , its cm , manohar joshi ,
appointed a renegotiating committee in 1996 which made the right noises ,
actually managing to reduce the tariff . but certain things remained
inexplicable . no fresh clearances were required from the cea , which also said
that "" since no cost increase was involved . . . fresh formal clearance wasn ' t
necessary . "" says the committee : "" this only adds strength to the suspicion
that the cea didn ' t consider the economic aspects of the project at all .
indeed , given the non - availability of any official record of the meeting on
june 24 , 1994 , with the committee and the nature of this letter dated
december 23 , 1994 , the committee is doubtful whether the economic aspects of
dpc were discussed at all . ' '
the credibility of the shiv sena - bjp government has been seriously
questioned . "" the committee finds it unexplicable ( sic ) why there was no
mention of any reduction in capital cost of the project from $ 2 , 828 million
to $ 2 , 501 million as agreed by dpc in the summary report of the renegotiating
committee , "" the panel observes . says lawyer prashant bhushan : "" it is strange
that the shiv sena - bjp government first filed a writ in the court and then
coolly renegotiated the deal . "" the committee further spells out the losses
incurred through the deal . "" subsequent to the commissioning of the dpc , the
financial deterioration of mseb has been rapid . while the mseb was in profit
in 1998 - 99 , it plunged into huge losses of rs 1681 crore in 1999 - 2000 . ""
significantly , the world bank in 1993 had predicted the system ' s inherent
weaknesses . in a letter written to the then power secretary , r . vasudevan , a
top bank official had said that "" after a detailed review of the analytical
framework and costing assumptions , we reconfirm our earlier conclusion that
the dabhol project , as presently formulated , is not economically justified ""
and that in "" our assessment the project is too large to enter the mseb system
in 1998 . the proposed base - load operation could result in uneconomic plant
dispatch , as already existing lower variable cost coal power would be
replaced by the higher cost lng power . ""
enron ' s persistence and the ' gullibility ' of the indian side can be gauged
from high - ranking enron official joe sutton ' s letter to a key indian
official , ajit nimbalkar : "" i recently met with the world bank and have been
following the articles in the india papers . i feel that the world bank
opinion can be changed . we ' ll engage a pr firm and hopefully manage the media
from here on . the project has solid support from all other agencies in
washington . ""
the key question in the enron deal is whether a developed state like
maharashtra needs outside intervention in the power sector at all ? for the
first time the godbole committee has raised objections about the viability of
such a project . according to the report , the mseb has been one of the better
performing boards in the country and has , despite a faulty transmission and
distribution ( t and d ) system , managed to consistently earn net revenue
surpluses on an accrual basis .
maharashtra accounts for nearly one - fourth of the gross value of india ' s
industrial sector . it ' s one of the few states to achieve 100 per cent
electrification . since ' 95 , the mseb has been adding to its generation . "" this
improvement , which has been largely due to renovation and modernisation
undertaken by the mseb , exceeded its own expectations at a time when the dpc
was being considered , "" the report points out . following a policy of
cross - subsidy , roughly nine out of its ten users are subsidised .
but the gap between the average cost of supply and average realisation hasn ' t
been much . in fact , the subsidy claim decreased from rs 630 crore in 1995 - 96
to rs 355 crore in 1998 - 99 , until in 1999 - 2000 it increased nearly five - fold
to rs 2 , 084 crore due to the sudden increase in the gap by 26 paise per unit  *
from 15 to 41 paise  * an increase of 173 per cent . "" the increase in the subsidy
claim by rs 1 , 729 crore is due to the increase in the gap principally because
of the increase in power purchase costs , "" says the committee , adding :
"" without the dpc and without problems of t and d loss , the mseb could be
financially healthy . ""
but can that happen now since enron is here to stay ? the committee has come
up with some far - reaching recommendations : make public all dabhol - related
documents and agreements , restructure the dabhol project itself to bring down
the cost of power , restructure dpc financially , allow sale of dpc power
outside maharashtra , re - examine ppas in accordance with least - cost plans , and
thoroughly reform the mseb . the committee know this can become reality only
with political consensus and through forming of public opinion . the question
is , can that be achieved in an unstable political environment ?

mseb revenue collections up at rs 968 crore in march , renni abraham
the maharashtra state electricity board ' s ( mseb ) revenue collections in march
2001 stood at a record rs 968 crore . this was largely due to the
disconnection drive on defaulter connections - - pegged at nearly 20 , 000
disconnections a month - - which resulted in compliance by consumers . with the
dabhol power company ( dpc ) monthly financial burden issue now a topic of
discussion among arbitrators on the negotiating table , the mseb has turned to
putting its house in order .
as if to ward of any criticism of its fiscal condition that could be termed
as the facilitator to the entire dpc tariff crisis , the state electricity
board has put matters relating to its performance on record . for instance ,
mseb has recorded the highest power generation in the year ended march 31 ,
2001 , at 45930 units , compared with the previous year ' s 45582 units , making
it the top seb of the country in this respect . similarly its power stations
recorded the highest availability percentage at 86 . 1 up from 84 . 6 per cent
last fiscal . plant load factor is up to 72 . 78 per cent , compared with 71 . 7
per cent in 2000 .
the parli power station has recorded the highest ever generation in the ten
years of its life time in 2000 at 4545 million units , which made it eligible
for the meritorious productivity award under the eligibility guidelines
issued by the government of india carrying a cash award of rs 12 . 5 lakh . all
other power stations in the state , without exception , also fulfill the
eligibility criteria for the cash award , a senior mseb official said .
similarly , the chandrapur power station became the first power station of any
state electricity board to get the iso 9002 certification .
a senior mseb official said : "" earlier mseb was suffering from too much
interference in its day to day functioning . the agriculturists were touted as
the major reason for its deteriorating accruals , while theft of electricity
during the transmission and distribution stage was conveniently camouflaged
under this head . in the recent past , the government has authorised mseb to
take steps to curb this misuse of power by its own officials , many of whom ,
including a chief engineer have suffered suspensions",NO_IGNORE

the basis report has been updated to cover 2000 prices . it is called
basisnw 7 . xls and is in the erg database .
it looks to be working correctly , but of course without data it is a little
hard to confirm . as always , it is ultimately your job to verify that the
numbers reported are correct . lemme know if there are problems .
it is easy to change the spreadsheet to start a new year . you should keep
this mail message as a reference .
1 ) add 12 to the expression in "" printmacro "" ! b 35 i . e . change
copy ( offset ( henrycash , 12 * againstyear + 63 , i , 12 , 1 ) ) to
2 ) define a new cell reference on the basis page for the first date to be
printed out on the report page . for example , last year , the basis report
went from jan 93 to dec 1999 . in basisnw 6 . xls there is a name "" jan 93 "" defined
as "" basis "" ! a 64 ( i . e . refers to the row where the jan 1993 basis numbers are
recorded ) . this year , in basisnw 7 . xls , i defined "" jan 94 "" to refer to
"" basis "" ! a 76 . that ' s because the basis report will now run from jan 1994 to
dec 2000 .
3 ) change the expression in "" printmacro "" ! b 45 to use this new cell reference
i . e . change copy ( offset ( jan 93 , 12 * indexyear , report , 12 , 1 ) ) to
4 ) having executed steps 1 ) - 3 ) the spreadsheet will now print numbers
shifted up by one year . all that remains to do is to change the dates on the

( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . )
new york - ( dow jones ) - reports over the weekend that embattled enron corp . ( ene ) might be the object of a takeover bid failed to move the company ' s bonds monday .
on sunday , the independent in london reported that royal dutch petroleum co . ( rd ) planned to mount an $ 11 billion offering for the company . and barron ' s stated that there was speculation that enron might attract takeover interest from either royal dutch or warren buffet ' s berkshire hathaway inc . ( brka ) .
enron ' s bonds are quoted in dollar prices and not in terms of a spread in relation to treasury bond issues .
a $ 74 bid and a $ 77 offer was quoted as the market for enron ' s 7 - 7 / 8 % bonds of 2003 monday morning , similar to friday ' s levels .
"" the company ' s bonds were quoted in the low - to mid - 70 s on friday and the rumors have not shown up in that pricing , "" said wayne schmidt , portfolio manager , advantus capital management , st . paul , minn .
"" market perception and not takeover rumors impact the pricing of the bonds , "" said eric bergson , portfolio manager , northern trust global investments , chicago .
even an enron bond with a very short time to maturity is not trading at par , traders said .
the 6 . 45 % coupon bond due on november 15 , 2001 , less than two weeks away , was bid at a dollar price of 99 .
"" some investors don ' t want to own anything with a downside risk , "" said harold rivkin , principal , h . rivkin & co . , a distressed debt brokerage firm , princeton , n . j . the bonds could lose a lot of value in that time frame , with little upside potential gain , he added .
there is "" very little liquidity in the company ' s bonds , "" said rivkin . enron ' s bonds will follow the company ' s stock movements , he added . enron closed monday at $ 11 . 03 , down $ 0 . 27 from friday ' s close of $ 11 . 30 .
enron officials weren ' t immediately available to comment .
crisis of investor confidence
the houston - based energy services company has faced a crisis of investor confidence since it reported a $ 618 million third quarter loss and a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity last month .
and last wednesday , the company said that the securities and exchange commission had elevated to a formal investigation its inquiry into enron ' s financial dealings with partnerships headed by its former chief financial officer , andrew fastow .
the ratings agencies have reacted to the company ' s liquidity problems brought about by the loss in investor confidence . fitch downgraded enron ' s senior unsecured debt monday to triple - b - minus , from triple - b - plus . it ' s now just a notch away from junk bond status .
last week , standard & poor ' s corp . lowered the credit rating to triple - b , while moody ' s investors service lowered the rating to baa 2 .
shell may have interest , but
royal dutch shell may have an interest in enron , say analysts .

market views enron takeover rumors with skepticism
by christina cheddar

dow jones news service
( copyright ( c ) 2001 , dow jones & company , inc . )
new york - ( dow jones ) - with each day shedding light on new revelations about enron corp . ' s ( ene ) financial dealings , it is difficult to put odds on the company as a takeover target .
but speculation has been persistent that royal dutch / shell group may use enron ' s weakened position to launch either a friendly or hostile takeover .
over the weekend , the british newspaper , the independent , fanned the flames of speculation again by saying that shell was expected to offer $ 11 billion for the houston energy trader .
a shell spokesman wasn ' t immediately available .
surely , enron ' s thousands of miles of pipeline assets would provide a company such as the anglo - dutch oil giant with a great advantage in the u . s . natural gas market , where shell has maintained it wants to increase its presence .
however , a great deal of study would be needed to uncover the potential liabilities lurking in the company ' s financial structure . enroll has used a web of off - balance sheet financing vehicles to fund its growing business and preserve its credit rating thereby lowering its borrowing costs .
some have also alleged the company used the structure to shift losses off its balance sheet .
several arbitrageur traders said it is unlikely a conservative company such as shell would want to make an acquisition while a securities and exchange commission investigation is pending .
as for enron ' s core franchise - its energy marketing and trading business - it could be easily argued that the most valuable asset there is enron ' s staff . as a result , it would help if deal were friendly because such a transaction could protect against the attrition sometimes associated with hostile transactions .
shell has been growing its own position in the wholesale energy marketing and trading sector through its coral energy unit , and the acquisition of enron could give it instant clout in the market . also , shell ' s strong balance sheet would provide the market will necessary assurance of creditworthiness .
traders and those who follow corporate mergers and acquisitions agreed it would be better for any prospective buyer to wait it out until the situation calmed and more details of enron ' s business are uncovered .
a growth - fund manager , who requested anonymity , also said it is important to know where the rumors are coming from given the decline in enron ' s stock price . he speculated that some hedge fund managers might be attempting to use the rumor to stir up interest in the battered stock .
enron shares recently traded at $ 11 . 14 , down 16 cents , or 1 . 4 % . the stock began the day in positive territory , and traded as high as $ 12 . 20 intraday .
the stock has declined more than 60 % since the company in mid - october posted a third - quarter charge of more than $ 1 billion . the company also later disclosed an additional $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholders ' equity caused by the early termination of controversial outside partnerships run by its former chief financial officer andy fastow .
in the weeks that followed the disclosure , enron ' s credit rating was downgraded by moody ' s investor service , standard 201 - 938 - 5166 ; christina . cheddar @ dowjones . com
copyright ? 2000 dow jones they are very smart and very wise to the ways of wall street , main street and the oil patch .
norman blake is a gent i met years ago at usfg , before he sold it at a huge profit . this man has recently served as ceo of comdisco , a leasing company that is not only comfortable with debt and financing , it is wallowing in it .
blake has general electric training . this man can smell things that are not so right from miles away . where was he in all of this ? stuck in comdisco hell ?
ronnie chan is a longtime kingpin in hong kong , a place where financial originality is always on display . chan certainly would have understood how unseemly all of these 17 partnerships would have appeared . he ' s seen everything over in kong .
john duncan is an energy investment guy , a director of eott energy , and a seasoned pro who knows oil and gas financing and accounting . again , very sophisticated .
wendy gramm regulated derivatives . she was the chairman of the cftc and a director of the chicago mercantile exchange . how could she not have spotted this obvious conflict and probed what these partnerships entailed ? that was part of her old job .
robert jaedicke was a professor of accounting at stanford business school , where he was also dean . this guy wrote the book on this stuff and really should have seen it coming .
( i am skipping ken lay , the ceo . )
charles lemaistre and john mendelsohn , two execs from the university of texas m . d . anderson cancer center , can ' t be expected to catch this stuff , and therefore gets a pass from me .
paulo ferraz pereira is a former president and chief executive officer of the state bank of rio de janeiro . that ' s probably put him in more than his fair share of difficult financial situations . how could he not raise a word about it ?
frank savage serves as chairman of alliance capital management international , perhaps the most sophisticated company in the world of money management . i am sure savage never saw a situation as bad as enron ' s looking through his own company ' s portfolio of investments .
jeffrey skilling , the man who resigned as ceo , needs to be heard from . we know that he is a director of the houston branch of the federal reserve bank of dallas , a sinecure that slouches and undervigilant execs don ' t get hold . what did he know and when did he know it ?
john wakeham , lord wakeham to everybody , is perhaps the most financially sophisticated brit to serve in parliament . he managed a large private practice as a chartered accountant . he ' s big and powerful and smart .
herbert winokur is a longtime financial hand who also has run investment partnerships and used to serve as a director of penn central , a place that saw more than its share of ups and downs and tricky financial situations .
in short , this is the most sophisticated , hands - on group of folks i have come across . i can ' t believe they checked off on this stuff . i have to believe they didn ' t know , or if they knew of the partnerships , i believe they had no idea what they were doing .
i want so badly to presume that these partnerships were simply set up to take down a lot of debt and not hurt enron ' s credit rating with the agencies - - not that that ' s such an ethical setup . but at least it makes me think that the board might have been confused or not focused because it would have seemed unimportant , as they might not have known how big and how extended the partnerships were .
still , let ' s not fool ourselves . this was a powerhouse , fantastic , upright board of people who know a thing or two . i can ' t believe they let this stuff occur . i think they knew nothing .
which is pretty terrible in its own right .

d ? j ? vu circa 1991 . that ' s what i keep thinking about . i recall that time vividly . bank of boston , chase , chemical , citibank , they all started rallying . we bears would call each other and joke about it . we would say that it was a ridiculous move , that it should be shorted and shorted aggressively , because there was no way that any of these banks would make it .
heck , bank of boston was teetering on insolvency . citibank was technically bankrupt already . the jim grants of the world ( more powerful now than they were then because he didn ' t have as many years of being dead wrong but erudite under his belt ) would be alerting everyone to the absurdity of the common stocks of the banks rallying .
i would call the analysts , and they wouldn ' t know anything either - - the ones who liked the banks all the way down , who still liked them and who had no credibility at all . the ones who hated them didn ' t want to get off the winning horses . they didn ' t know that the race was over and that a new one had begun .
or , to put it the brutal way that i now know was right : no one with a brain was long any of these .
turns out , of course , that brains were one of those commodities that was wildly overvalued at the bottom . what you had to do was check your skepticism and embrace optimism , because at certain points in history optimists get it right .
that ' s how i feel about this market . i think the time to be skeptical was before all of the damage occurred . i think we will look back at this period and say the following : the great bear market started in march 2000 and was continuing to run rampant until sept . 11 , the crisis that triggered a massive influx of liquidity and lower interest rates that turned things around . most of the brains at the time were thinking that nothing really could change and that we were going to slide into a japanese recession or that no turn would ever come . they were wrong , just like they were in 1991 .
we get so caught up in the "" is cisco bottoming ? "" or "" is intel breaking out ? "" minutiae that we forget that the market has been pretty good for some time now , pretty good since that crescendo selloff two months ago .
you would think that we ' d have converted more bears to bulls by now , but like in 1991 , it didn ' t happen until well into the turn .
don ' t confuse my optimism with some cold hard realities . i think that , for example , xo communications is going to fail , and when it does , there will be the requisite selloff and setbacks to tech . i think that mcleod is going to fail and we will see the same . there are a ton of companies that won ' t get through this period , just like there were a ton of banks and savings and loans that failed long after the turn came in 1991 .
and i reserve the right to hate individual stocks . i can ' t get my arms around how ford comes back ; i don ' t understand the enron fiasco at all . i am not even sure that qwest can staunch the bleeding .
but that doesn ' t make me bearish .
understand that i am strictly a pavlovian creature . had i not lived through the giant financial short squeezes of late 1990 and early 1991 , had i not personally been "" bought in "" on a half - dozen banks i was shorting and had i not later on seen those banks get big bids from super - regionals not long after i , too , would be suspicious and want to bet against the market . i can ' t , though , because my capacity for loss remembrance is so much greater than my ability to remember my wins that the pattern stays in my head like a hot stove that i don ' t want to get burned by again .
believe me , i am a cold - blooded individual about these things . if i thought the short side was the right side here , i would be all over it . we have had a huge bounce off the bottom ; there would be nothing "" unpatriotic "" about saying "" get out now . ""
but i don ' t think that ' s right . i think this market ' s going to keep working here .
if it doesn ' t , people will email me and harangue me and make fun of me , and i will say , c ' est la vie , i took a stand ; it was wrong . taking stands , however , is what it is all about . knowing your context and making money with that context is what i do and have done for 20 years . if you don ' t have a context , if you don ' t have a view , there ' s only one thing to do : give your money to others who do .
random musings : glenn curtis ' s era of value newsletter has been making me money . when something makes me money i talk about it . check it out here . curtis and gary b . smith both are doing some terrific things . understand , i get all of the newsletters out there . i see the hype that a navallier or a murphy puts out and i want to puke . this stuff is nothing like that , nothing at all . it is honest , candid and doesn ' t guarantee that you will shoot the lights out , like those who you know can ' t . . . on my radio show , it ' s mutual fund monday , where we will fix your 401 ( k ) ) . call me at 1 - 800 - 862 - 8686 from 3 p . m . to 4 p . m . et .",NO_IGNORE

"as our existing businesses grow and new businesses are created , ease of
movement and development of our top talent becomes essential to our success .
as you heard at the management conference all officers will be titled ,
reviewed , promoted , and compensated according to a more standard set of
guidelines . the process recognizes the intrinsic value of each officer ,
rather than tying that individual to the value of their specific job or
reporting relationship .
officer titling has been standardized throughout enron . there are four
levels of officers : members of the enron office of the chairman make up level
4 . level 3 includes all other members of the enron executive committee .
level 2 is made up of managing directors , including company presidents and
some senior vice presidents . level 1 are vice presidents and some senior
vice presidents with grandfathered titles .
this year a common evaluation process is being implemented for level 1 and
level 2 officers . officers will be evaluated by a committee , through a
process referred to as the performance review committee ( prc ) , utilizing a
standard set of performance criteria and performance ratings . performance
committee reviews will occur twice a year  ) in july for feedback purposes and
at year - end for feedback as well as bonus and total compensation
considerations . the executive committee will handle the prc for all level 2
officers . review of level 1 officers will occur at the business - unit level
first with the results  & cross calibrated  8 by the executive committee and a
group of approximately sixteen managing directors .
the goals of the prc process is to insure a consistent standard for our
overall pool of executive talent and to provide a tool to more effectively
utilize talent throughout the organization . to further promote consistency
the executive committee will consider all promotions in january of each
year . exceptions , internally or externally , will be infrequent .
the individual  , s performance evaluation will be the starting point for all
compensation decisions . compensation includes base pay , bonus and long - term
awards . a long - term program that replaces individual or business unit plans
has been approved and will be communicated to individuals before bonus
payments are made .
in addition to the level 1 and level 2 reviews , business unit , global and
corporate cross - functional prc reviews for directors , senior directors and
general managers have started . this year - end process will be utilized as a
benchmark to determine how we further refine the evaluation process at this
level in the future .

your human resources business unit leads per the following :

"the following short quiz consists of 4 questions and will tell you
whether you are qualified to be a "" professional . ""
scroll down for each answer . the questions are not that difficult and
this won ' t take long at all .
1 . how do you put a giraffe into a refrigerator ?
>
>
>
>
>
>
>

>
>
>
the correct answer is : open the refrigerator put in the giraffe and
close the door .
this question tests whether you tend to do simple things in an overly
complicated way .
2 . how do you put an elephant into a refrigerator ?
>

>
wrong answer : open the refrigerator put in the elephant and close the
refrigerator .
correct answer : open the refrigerator , take out the giraffe , put in the
elephant and close the door .
this tests your ability to think through the repercussions of your
previous actions .
3 . the lion king is hosting an animal conference . all the animals
attend except one . which animal does not attend ?
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
>
correct answer : the elephant . the elephant is in the refrigerator .
this tests your memory . ok , even if you did not answer the first three
questions correctly , you still have one more chance to show your true
abilities .
4 . there is a river you must cross . but it is inhabited by crocodiles .
how do you manage it ?

correct answer : you swim across . all the crocodiles are attending the
animal meeting .
this tests whether you learn quickly from your mistakes .
according to anderson consulting worldwide , around 90 % of the
professionals they tested got all questions wrong . but many preschoolers
got several correct answers .
anderson consulting says this conclusively disproves the theory that
most professionals have the brains of a four year old . send this out to

i have had several requests from the ena business groups . now that the
agreement has been finalized , for report lists from your key applications ,
those
being , altra gms and risk works ( there may be others as people become more
aware ) . there will be a need for information for ena to manage contracts as we
go through he transition period . we feel this would be an easier process to
work
through if ena knows what kind of information they can request as we go
through
the transition .

"today , we announced plans to merge with dynegy , a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties . dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own . we believe merging with dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you ' ve worked so hard to build . following are the major components of the transaction .
deal terms
- - the transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0 . 2685 dynegy shares for every enron share . for example , each 1 , 000 shares of enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of dynegy upon closing , plus cash for fractional shares , upon closing .
- - chevrontexaco owns approximately 26 percent of dynegy ' s outstanding common stock . chevrontexaco will invest $ 1 . 5 billion in dynegy immediately and an additional $ 1 billion in dynegy on closing of the merger . dynegy will immediately invest $ 1 . 5 billion in cash in enron ' s northern natural gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in northern natural gas .
- - total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares .
- - the transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals , and is expected to close late next year .
enron will have immediate access to dynegy ' s $ 1 . 5 billion cash investment in enron ' s northern natural gas subsidiary .
management of newly formed company
chuck watson will be chairman and ceo of the newly formed company , which will be called dynegy inc . , and steve bergstrom will be president and coo .
i will continue to serve as chairman and ceo of enron until the transaction closes . i will not join the dynegy office of the chairman . greg whalley will continue to serve as president and coo of enron until the transaction closes . then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the dynegy office of the chairman . mark frevert will continue as vice chairman of enron .
management from enron and dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth , efficient integration . the make - up of the integration team has not yet been determined .
the merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002 . this merger will create an enormous growth engine , providing great opportunities for our employees , shareholders and customers . as with any merger , some elimination of positions is almost inevitable , and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company . we hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions . clearly , we cannot rule out involuntary separation , but dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations . i promise you that i will do everything i can to make this transition as smooth as possible .
as i said in my video , this is a day like no other in our company ' s history . we considered several options , but we believe that this merger with dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence , strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses .
i know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps . we have a list of frequently asked questions posted at . if you have additional questions , please submit them to questions @ enron . com . we will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions . if you receive any calls from the media , please refer them to our media team at ( 713 ) 853 - 5670 .
i ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company . rather than closing doors , we are opening new ones , as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise , including our market reach , financial strength and industry experience . together , we will be a new merchant powerhouse .
and again , thank you for everything you have done for enron .
investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement / prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available , because it will contain important information . investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement / prospectus ( when it is available ) and other documents containing information about dynegy and enron , without charge , at the sec ' s web site at www . sec . gov . copies of the joint proxy statement / prospectus and the sec filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement / prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either : investor relations , dynegy inc . , 1000 louisiana , suite 5800 , houston , tx 77002 , phone : ( 713 ) 507 - 6400 , fax : ( 713 ) 507 - 6808 ; or investor relations , enron corp . , 1400 smith street , houston , tx 77002 , phone : ( 713 ) 853 - 3956 , fax : ( 713 ) 646 - 3002 .
in addition , the identity of the persons who , under sec rules , may be considered "" participants in the solicitation "" of dynegy and enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions , and any description of their direct or indirect interests , by security holdings or otherwise , are available in an sec filing under schedule 14 a made by each of dynegy and enron .",NO_IGNORE

brian ,
the memo as written is fine .
i do have a general concern about the need for a rigid and corporate based qualification process for contractors . maybe this is influenced by just visiting dabhol and seeing first hand the problems we have created by using marginally qualified contractors , but to me it would make sense to have a corporate based team including rac for this function . financial positions of engineering and construction contractors are difficult to understand . it is a business that does not neatly fit a yearly reporting concept and requires significant experience to evaluate . i doubt your epc team will have the time to adequately perform this function . a small team continuously working as a committee on the evaluation of contractors could prevent a lot of tears . i believe strongly in looking at new contractors especially private ones with strong leadership , but we need to clearly identify the risk . in addition the entire e & c industry is at risk due to thin margins and / or risk .

october 1 . if the transport expires before then , then we ' ll need to call

john and louise -
based on your meeting with kevin and dave earlier today , i understand you would like a breakdown of the expenditures expected to develop a texas coal plant to the point that it can be monetized .
the below is my best estimate for developing the brownsville site to get to the monetization point ( permits in hand and epc contract signed ) . i expect to have both an epc contract and permits in hand some time around sep ' 02 if we start with the expenditures in mid july ' 01 . expenditures will be incurred at the rate of approximately $ 350 , 000 per month for the next 12 months . we can back out at any time with only prompt month plus one additional month committed .
costs for a florida site will be similar ; however , expenditures will not start until we achieve site control .
my recommendation is to start fully developing the brownsville , tx site with a plan to flip the site once we have a permit , as market conditions warrant . i recommend holding off on significant expenditures in florida until we get more comfortable with site control .

hi chonawee ,
you are right , i did make a mistake on the calculation , though it isn ' t
exactly 2 / 3 of the previous 3 pak quote . sorry about that and so glad you
caught it . i multiplied by 1 . 5 and i meant to use 1 . 3 . we have discounted
deployment paks which we discount by quantity . our chart starts with a 3
pak so i took that number from our price list and multiplied by 1 . 3 to get
14 , 560 . 00 . for 2 deployments , i take $ 4 , 500 for one , plus 10 % off for the
second license 4 , 050 , then times 1 . 3 = 11 , 115 . 00 . here is the revised
quote . i checked the other numbers again and they are correct . again , i am
sorry for the mistake .

"as you know , enron has signed a merger agreement by which dynegy will acquire enron . we expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing .
even though enron has entered into this agreement , u . s . and foreign antitrust laws require that enron and dynegy continue to operate independently of each other . in particular , to the extent that enron and dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets , their respective activities must be undertaken at arm ' s length until the transaction has closed . therefore , for antitrust purposes you should treat dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement .
in addition , all information , documents and communications related to the merger between enron and dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by mark muller , lance schuler , robert eickenroht , mark haedicke , rob walls or greg whalley of enron . it is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained . to the extent that information is required to be disclosed to dynegy under the merger agreement , then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals .

"Action Required for your Amazon Application – Complete Assessment
Amazon.jobs
	
Hi Michael Gary Scott,
Thank you for your interest in Amazon! The next step of the application process is the online assessment. The assessment that you are about to complete is an important part of the hiring process to help us learn more about you. Please complete this online assessment in the next two weeks. If you do not complete it, you will not move forward in the hiring process.
Before beginning your online assessment, please review the following instructions and helpful hints:
 Do not click the ‘Start the assessment’ link below until you are ready to start and complete the assessment.
 Please complete the assessment as soon as possible.
 Take the assessment in a quiet, distraction-free environment.
 Set aside 50-60 minutes in a place where you can focus to give yourself plenty of time to complete the assessment.
 Ensure you have a reliable internet connection during the assessment.
 While you are able to use a mobile device to take the assessment, we recommend completing it on a larger screen such as a tablet, laptop or desktop computer.
 You can find more information on assessments at Amazon here:
 https://www.amazon.jobs/en/landing_pages/assessments
 If you need an accommodation, more information can be found here: https://www.amazon.jobs/en/disability/us
 After completing the assessment, you can take an optional feedback survey.
 You will know you have completed the entire assessment when you see the confirmation page at the end.
To begin your assessment, use the link below:
Start My Assessment
Note: This link is unique to you.
Troubleshooting
 For any technical issues, refer to the troubleshooting guides in the assessment. If those do not work, examine closely where you left off, log out, and log back in using the link above. Please do not repeatedly refresh the screen.
 If technical issues cannot be resolved, please contact your recruiter immediately.
We recognize this is a large time investment. We value the people we hire and we appreciate your interest in Amazon. You will be contacted in the event we decide to move forward with your application.
FAQs
Want to catch a glimpse of what it is like working at Amazon?
 You can refer to amazon.jobs.
How can I best prepare for the assessment?
 Review the Assessments page on Amazon.jobs. Setting aside an appropriate amount of time and finding a quiet location will be important. Do not forget that a strong Internet connection is also key.
I cannot complete the online assessment within the number of days allocated. May I request an extension?
 Yes; however, Amazon hires on a rolling basis and a delay in completing the online assessment may impact your candidacy. If you require an extension, please email your recruiter and our team will follow up within three business days of your email.
Can I take a break during the assessment?
 Sure! We suggest taking a short break in between evaluation modules or sections. Stretch, move around or grab a glass of water before finishing the rest of the assessment. You don’t need to log out to take a quick break. If for some reason you do need to interrupt your session and log out, you can click on the “Start the assessment” link to log back in and resume.
What should I do, if due to a disability, I require accommodation prior to starting the assessment?
 Our inclusive culture empowers Amazonians to deliver the best results for our customers. We not only celebrate the diversity of our workforce, we celebrate the diverse ways we work in. If you have a disability and need an accommodation, please reach out to your recruiter or click on this link for more information, https://www.amazon.jobs/en/disability/us.
What should I do if I experience technical issues?
 For any technical issues, refer to the troubleshooting guides in the assessment. If those do not work, examine closely where you left off, log out and log back in using the link above. Please do not repeatedly refresh the screen. If technical issues cannot be resolved, please contact your recruiter immediately.
How can I be sure that I have submitted the assessment successfully?
 You will receive a confirmation email within a few minutes of your submission.

"Hi Michael Gary Scott,
Thank you for applying to the Data Analyst position. While this letter is automatically generated, our candidate review process is not. Here's what will happen next:
People, not robots read your resume. People who know about the position review each resume that is submitted to us.
Our goal is to have your resume reviewed within two weeks of submitting it to us.
If you're selected to move to the next stage of the interview process, a recruiter will reach out to conduct a preliminary phone screening.
If you're not selected for an interview, please know there are most likely several factors that influenced our decision. One major influencer is unfortunately out of your control - the strength of our candidate pool. Oftentimes, you may have good to great professional experience, but we have to send a rejection because of the level of competition for the role is so high.
Thank you again for submitting your resume for our review. We will make every effort to provide you with consistent communication during your candidacy with us, regardless of the outcome.
Please keep in mind, a QuinStreet Recruiter will never ask you to purchase equipment or ask for any personal information (ie - bank information, deposit checks, personal identity number, government identification) and will only receive email communication from our domains, @quinstreet.com and/or @us.greenhouse-mail.io.

If you are receiving an employment inquiry or employment offer from a non @pilot.com email address, please assume it is not genuine. Pilot never asks job seekers to make any payment as part of the recruiting process.

Thank you for applying to the Product Data Analyst with us. We appreciate the time you’ve taken to apply for the role and look forward to reviewing your application.
 
We know it can be exciting and scary applying for a job, so here is what you can expect next! 
 
Application Review. It will happen. As we sometimes get upwards of 100+ applications for some roles, it can take some time, but every applicant can expect a note regarding their application status.
 
Interview Selection. If we don’t set up a call for this job, don’t worry. It doesn’t mean you’re not a great fit for us, it just means that sometimes there is a lot of competition for a great job.
 
Interview Process. Every role starts the same, an introductory call with someone from our Recruitment team. We will be looking for company and values-fit as well as your professional experience; there may be some technical role-specific questions during this call. 
 
Every role is different after the initial call, but you can expect to meet several people from the team 1:1 and there might be further skill assessments in the form of a Take Home Assignment/Case Study Presentation or Pair Programming/Live Coding exercise depending on the role. In your initial call, we will walk you through exactly what to expect the process to be.
 
Where We Interview: Currently interviews are being conducted virtually, but for candidates that are comfortable and interested, we have started meeting people in our offices.
 
Transparency. We appreciate and value your time, so we try to make the on-site interview process as efficient as possible. Before every interview, you will receive a note letting you know what to expect as well as who you will be meeting.
 
Good luck and speak soon,
